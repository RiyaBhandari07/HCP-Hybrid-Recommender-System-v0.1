40887509,Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor-associated euglycaemic diabetic ketoacidosis in the emergency peri-operative period: a systematic review.,"Perioperative euglycaemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EuDKA) is a rare but life-threatening complication associated with sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). It is characterised by ketonaemia, acidosis, and normal serum glucose. Whilst guidelines advise withholding SGLT2i prior to elective surgery, limited guidance exists for emergency procedures. This systematic review aimed to describe EuDKA cases following emergency surgery, identify patient characteristics, and examine contributing risk factors. A search of electronic databases up to April 2024 identified 30 cases from 21 publications. In most cases, EuDKA onset occurred within three days postoperatively (range: intraoperative to 10 days). Reported risk factors included inadequate SGLT2i withholding time, poor glycaemic control, morbid obesity, major surgery, intercurrent illness, suboptimal intraoperative diabetes management, and delayed gastrointestinal absorption. Morbidity was significant: ten patients required intensive care, two required intubation and ventilation, two received dialysis, and one underwent exploratory laparotomy. No deaths were reported. Due to atypical biochemical findings and non-specific symptoms, EuDKA remains under-recognised. Clinicians are advised to maintain a high index of suspicion, ensure appropriate perioperative insulin management, conduct vigilant laboratory monitoring, and provide patient education to reduce the risk in emergency surgical settings.",Diabetes Management
40886230,Can Dual Incretin Receptor Agonists Exert Better Cardiovascular Protection than Selective GLP-1 Receptor Agonists? Highlights from SURPASS-CVOT.,"Despite advances in cardiovascular risk reduction in type 2 diabetes (T2D), a persistent gap remains compared to individuals without diabetes. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) have provided consistent cardiovascular benefits. With more cardiovascular protective agents available for diabetes management, their incremental effect may be nearing a ceiling. The SURPASS-CVOT trial innovatively compared the dual GIP/GLP-1RA tirzepatide with the selective GLP-1RA dulaglutide, demonstrating noninferiority for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; HR 0.92; 95.3% CI 0.83-1.01; p = 0.086) and suggesting a potential 28% MACE risk reduction versus an imputed placebo. However, superiority over dulaglutide was narrowly missed. Despite greater improvements in glycemia (0.8% greater HbA1c reduction) and weight (7% greater weight loss), tirzepatide appeared to confer limited incremental cardiovascular benefit, raising questions about mechanism saturation or trial design constraints. Exploratory analyses showed promising benefits on mortality and renal function but require cautious interpretation. The trial's active comparator/imputed placebo design reflects an evolving ethical and therapeutic landscape in diabetes care. Whether dual incretin receptor agonism can meaningfully exceed current cardioprotective thresholds remains uncertain. By now, we may need new paradigms to overcome what may turn out to be a therapeutic ceiling for cardiovascular protection in the T2D population.",Diabetes Management

40884731,Intrinsic Motivation Moderates the Effect of Family Conflict on Disordered Eating Behaviors in Adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes.,"Few studies have examined effects of intrinsic motivation (IM) on adaptive behaviors among adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D), although greater IM has been associated with less diabetes-related family conflict (FC) and increased regimen adherence. Greater FC has also been associated with disordered eating behaviors (DEBs). We examined the moderating role of IM between FC and DEBs in a culturally diverse sample of youth with T1D. 226 adolescents (Mage = 15.03, 59.3% female, 65.8% Hispanic, 19.0% Black, MA1c = 8.19%, 74.30% eligible for subsidized health insurance) completed pre-visit screening measures assessing IM, FC, and DEBs. Gender, race, ethnicity, A1c, BMI, and insurance status were obtained from medical records and treated as covariates. Black youth had higher rates of DEBs (p < .01) and A1c levels (p < .001) than White youth. Significant correlations were observed across study variables. Accounting for covariates, IM moderated the relationship between FC and DEBs, whereby the effect of FC on DEBs emerged strongest at low IM (p < .001). As IM levels increased, the effect of FC on DEBs decreased, making the relationship between FC and DEBs non-significant. Greater IM for diabetes management attenuates the association between FC and DEBs. Promoting IM may decrease FC and DEBs in youth with T1D.",Diabetes Management

40872492,Phytocannabinoids as Novel SGLT2 Modulators for Renal Glucose Reabsorption in Type 2 Diabetes Management.,"Background: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have transformed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) management by promoting glucosuria, lowering glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), blood pressure, and weight; however, their use is limited by genitourinary infections and ketoacidosis. Phytocannabinoids-bioactive compounds from Cannabis sativa-exhibit multi-target pharmacology, including interactions with cannabinoid receptors, Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors (PPARs), Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels, and potentially SGLT2. Objective: To evaluate the potential of phytocannabinoids as novel modulators of renal glucose reabsorption via SGLT2 and to compare their efficacy, safety, and pharmacological profiles with synthetic SGLT2 inhibitors. Methods: We performed a narrative review encompassing the following: (1) the molecular and physiological roles of SGLT2; (2) chemical classification, natural sources, and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of major phytocannabinoids (Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol or Δ9-THC, Cannabidiol or CBD, Cannabigerol or CBG, Cannabichromene or CBC, Tetrahydrocannabivarin or THCV, and β-caryophyllene); (3) in silico docking and drug-likeness assessments; (4) in vitro assays of receptor binding, TRP channel modulation, and glucose transport; (5) in vivo rodent models evaluating glycemic control, weight change, and organ protection; (6) pilot clinical studies of THCV and case reports of CBD/BCP; (7) comparative analysis with established synthetic inhibitors. Results: In silico studies identify high-affinity binding of several phytocannabinoids within the SGLT2 substrate pocket. In vitro, CBG and THCV modulate SGLT2-related pathways indirectly via TRP channels and CB receptors; direct IC50 values for SGLT2 remain to be determined. In vivo, THCV and CBD demonstrate glucose-lowering, insulin-sensitizing, weight-reducing, anti-inflammatory, and organ-protective effects. Pilot clinical data (n = 62) show that THCV decreases fasting glucose, enhances β-cell function, and lacks psychoactive side effects. Compared to synthetic inhibitors, phytocannabinoids offer pleiotropic benefits but face challenges of low oral bioavailability, polypharmacology, inter-individual variability, and limited large-scale trials. Discussion: While preclinical and early clinical data highlight phytocannabinoids' potential in SGLT2 modulation and broader metabolic improvement, their translation is impeded by significant challenges. These include low oral bioavailability, inconsistent pharmacokinetic profiles, and the absence of standardized formulations, necessitating advanced delivery system development. Furthermore, the inherent polypharmacology of these compounds, while beneficial, demands comprehensive safety assessments for potential off-target effects and drug interactions. The scarcity of large-scale, well-controlled clinical trials and the need for clear regulatory frameworks remain critical hurdles. Addressing these aspects is paramount to fully realize the therapeutic utility of phytocannabinoids as a comprehensive approach to T2DM management. Conclusion: Phytocannabinoids represent promising multi-target agents for T2DM through potential SGLT2 modulation and complementary metabolic effects. Future work should focus on pharmacokinetic optimization, precise quantification of SGLT2 inhibition, and robust clinical trials to establish efficacy and safety profiles relative to synthetic inhibitors.",Diabetes Management
40872486,Acrocomia aculeata Oil-Loaded Nanoemulsion: A Promising Candidate for Cancer and Diabetes Management.,"Background: Diabetes and cancer are two of the most life-threatening disorders affecting individuals of all ages worldwide. This study aimed to develop a novel Acrocomia aculeata (bocaiuva) fruit pulp oil-loaded nanoemulsion and evaluate its inhibitory effects on α-glucosidase and pancreatic lipase, as well as its antiglycant activity and cytotoxicity against cancer cells. Additionally, this study assessed the impact of both the oil and the nanoemulsion on blood cells. Methods: The pulp oil was extracted by cold pressing. The oil's physicochemical properties were determined according to the AOAC and the Brazilian Pharmacopeia. The lipid profile was performed by GC-MS. The nanoemulsion was prepared by the phase inversion method using ultrasonic stirring for particle size reduction and for homogenization. Response Surface Methodology was used for optimizing nanoemulsion preparation. Enzyme inhibition tests were conducted using assay kits. Cytotoxicity in cancer cells was evaluated using the Sulforhodamine B assay. Results: Comprehensive physicochemical and chemical characterization of bocaiuva oil was performed, identifying oleic acid (71.25%) as the main component. The oil contains 23.04% saturated fatty acids, 73.79% monounsaturated acids, and 3.0% polyunsaturated fatty acids. The nanoemulsion (particle size 173.6 nm; zeta potential -14.10 mV) inhibited α-glucosidase (IC50: 43.21 µg/mL) and pancreatic lipase (IC50: 41.99 µg/mL), and revealed a potent antiglycation effect (oxidative IC50: 18.36 µg/mL; non-oxidative pathway IC50: 16.33 µg/mL). The nanoemulsion demonstrated good cytotoxicity and selectivity against prostate cancer cells (IC50: 19.13 µg/mL) and breast cancer cells (IC50: 27.22 µg/mL), without inducing hemolysis, platelet aggregation, or anticoagulant effects. Conclusions: In this study, a comprehensive physical and chemical characterization of bocaiuva fruit pulp oil was conducted for the first time as a preliminary step toward its future standardization as an active ingredient in cosmetic and pharmaceutical formulations. The resulting nanoemulsion represents a novel alternative for managing diabetes and cancer. Although the nanoemulsion exhibited lower cytotoxicity compared to doxorubicin, it remains promising due to its composition of essential fatty acids, phenols, and carotenoids, which offer multiple health benefits. Further studies are needed to validate its efficacy and safety in clinical applications.",Diabetes Management
40871679,Beyond Green: The Therapeutic Potential of Chlorophyll and Its Derivatives in Diabetes Control.,"Chlorophyll, the green pigment essential for photosynthesis, abundantly found in green vegetables and algae, has attracted growing scientific interest for its potential therapeutic effects, particularly in diabetes management. Recent research highlighted that chlorophyll and its derivatives may beneficially influence glucose metabolism and oxidative stress, key factors in diabetes. This review examines current knowledge on how chlorophyll compounds could aid diabetes control. Chlorophyll and its derivatives appear to support glucose regulation primarily through actions in the gastrointestinal tract. They modulate gut microbiota, improve glucose tolerance, reduce inflammation, and alleviate obesity-related markers. While chlorophyll itself does not directly inhibit digestive enzymes like α-glucosidase, its derivatives such as pheophorbide a, pheophytin a, and pyropheophytin a may slow carbohydrate digestion, acting as α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitors, reducing postprandial glucose spikes. Additionally, chlorophyll enhances resistant starch content, further controlling glucose absorption. Beyond digestion, chlorophyll derivatives show promise in inhibiting glycation processes, improving insulin sensitivity through nuclear receptor modulation, and lowering oxidative stress. However, some compounds pose risks due to photosensitizing effects and toxicity, warranting careful consideration. Chlorophyllin, a stable semi-synthetic derivative, also shows potential in improving glucose and lipid metabolism. Notably, pheophorbide a demonstrates insulin-mimetic activity by stimulating glucose uptake via glucose transporters, offering a novel therapeutic avenue. Overall, the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and insulin-mimicking properties of chlorophyll derivatives suggest a multifaceted approach to diabetes management. While promising, these findings require further clinical validation to establish effective therapeutic applications.",Diabetes Management
40871634,In Vitro Assessment of the Bioaccessibility and Hypoglycemic Properties of Essential Amino Acids Blend: Implication for Diabetes Management.,"Background/Objectives: Essential amino acid (EAA) supplementation is often employed in sportive and clinical nutrition due to EAAs' role in muscle mass maintenance and growth. EAAs are also involved in insulin and glucagone regulation in diabetes management, but only few reports investigate their possible implication as dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors and their effect on the stability and secretion of enteroendocrine hormones. A blend of EAAs (called GAF) available as a food supplement, in a specific qualitative and quantitative ratio, was investigated to address its in vitro bioaccessibility, its hypoglycemic properties in vitro and in situ on cellular models, and its safety on intestinal Caco-2 cells. Methods: GAF was subjected to the INFOGEST static digestion protocol, producing the iGAF sample. iGAf DPP-IV inhibitory properties were investigated both in vitro and in situ on Caco-2 cells. Then, STC-1 enteroendocrine cells were employed alone and in co-culture with Caco-2 cells to evaluate iGAF's impact on glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) hormone secretion. Results: The study demonstrates that the present EAAs blend is stable and bioaccessible after simulated gastrointestinal digestion, and it is safe at the intestinal cellular level. It inhibits DPP-IV enzyme both in vitro and in situ and promotes GLP-1 secretion by enteroendocrine cells. Conclusions: The sample demonstrated safety at the intestinal level and showed hypoglycemic properties by acting on a dual synergic mechanism that involves DPP-IV enzyme inhibition and GLP-1 hormone stimulation.",Diabetes Management

40870448,Barriers and Facilitators to Artificial Intelligence Implementation in Diabetes Management from Healthcare Workers' Perspective: A Scoping Review.,"Background and Objectives: Diabetes is a global public health challenge, with increasing prevalence worldwide. The implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in the management of this condition offers potential benefits in improving healthcare outcomes. This study primarily investigates the barriers and facilitators perceived by healthcare professionals in the adoption of AI. Secondarily, by analyzing both quantitative and qualitative data collected, it aims to support the potential development of AI-based programs for diabetes management, with particular focus on a possible bottom-up approach. Materials and Methods: A scoping review was conducted following PRISMA-ScR guidelines for reporting and registered in the Open Science Framework (OSF) database. The study selection process was conducted in two phases-title/abstract screening and full-text review-independently by three researchers, with a fourth resolving conflicts. Data were extracted and assessed using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) tools. The included studies were synthesized narratively, combining both quantitative and qualitative analyses to ensure methodological rigor and contextual depth. Results: The adoption of AI tools in diabetes management is influenced by several barriers, including perceived unsatisfactory clinical performance, high costs, issues related to data security and decision-making transparency, as well as limited training among healthcare workers. Key facilitators include improved clinical efficiency, ease of use, time-saving, and organizational support, which contribute to broader acceptance of the technology. Conclusions: The active and continuous involvement of healthcare workers represents a valuable opportunity to develop more effective, reliable, and well-integrated AI solutions in clinical practice. Our findings emphasize the importance of a bottom-up approach and highlight how adequate training and organizational support can help overcome existing barriers, promoting sustainable and equitable innovation aligned with public health priorities.",Diabetes Management
40869603,Gender Differences in Type 1 Diabetes Management and Mental Health Burden: Findings from a National Survey in Saudi Arabia.,"Background: T1D is generally associated with increased psychological burden, but evidence from Middle Eastern populations remains scarce. The present study assessed the gender differences in management, prevalence, and risk factors of perceived depression and anxiety among people with T1D in Saudi Arabia. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among people withT1D across Saudi Arabia to collect demographic, clinical, and diabetes management data. Perceived depression and anxiety symptoms were assessed using a validated questionnaire. Multinomial logistic regression was used to identify risk factors of severe depression and anxiety. Results: Among 1073 PwT1D (303 males and 770 females), perceived depressive and anxiety symptoms were highly prevalent. Females had higher perceived anxiety compared with males (p = 0.003). Age- and BMI-adjusted regression analysis showed that, overall, higher income (p = 0.008), no neuropathy (p = 0.002), above-average benefit from the diabetes education clinic (p = 0.02), practicing carbohydrate counting (p = 0.002), and HbA1c < 7.0% (p = 0.01) were protective against perceived severe depression. Friends with T1D as the preferred education source (odds ratio [OR] = 2.8, p = 0.04) and a rejected request for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) (OR = 1.88, p = 0.02) or insulin pump (OR = 2.8, p = 0.001) were significant risk factors. Perceived severe anxiety was associated with insulin pump rejection (OR = 2.4, p < 0.001) and self-reading as the preferred education source (OR = 2.0, p = 0.03). Being male (p = 0.02), no neuropathy (p = 0.01), practicing carbohydrate counting (p < 0.001), and HbA1c < 7.0% (p = 0.001) were protective. Conclusions: Symptoms of depression and anxiety are highly prevalent among people with T1D in Saudi Arabia, with females and socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals at greater risk.

40869081,Eggplant (Solanum spp.) Fruits Dietary Polyphenols Upregulate the Expression of Glucose Transporter Protein in Palmitate-Induced Diabetic Cell Line C2C12.,"Studies utilizing cell-based systems to investigate plant-based diets for diabetes management are gaining attention due to the adverse effects associated with commercially available drugs. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-diabetic effects of specific plant-derived products remain inadequately explored. The major aim of our study was to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which bioactive compounds in the fruit of Solanum spp. influence key proteins associated with type 2 diabetes. The expressions of genes such as glucose transporter protein 4 (GLUT4), myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF-2A), and nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1) were investigated in a palmitate-induced C2C12 cell model of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The structures of these proteins were retrieved from the protein database, while bioactive compounds previously identified in Solanum spp. were obtained from PubChem site. Drug-likeness properties of these compounds (ligands) were assessed. The docked protein-ligand complexes were further analyzed using the Protein-Ligand Profiler web server. Our results showed that the studied compounds from Solanum spp. profoundly upregulated GLUT4 expression (9-19-fold increase) in the C2C12 cell line, thus surpassing the effects of the standard anti-diabetic drug metformin. Additionally, activities of antioxidant enzymes catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase were elevated. Molecular docking showed that rutin, an abundant flavonoid from Solanum spp., had the highest binding affinity for the active sites of the target proteins. These findings provide new mechanistic insight into the anti-diabetic effects of Solanum spp., primarily due to its high rutin content, which plays a major role in the plant's glucose-regulating and antioxidant actions. Our findings underscore the potential use of Solanum spp. as an affordable functional food for managing type 2 diabetes, especially in developing countries with limited resources for purchasing drugs. Although promising, our findings should be further validated by clinical studies.",Diabetes Management

40880508,"Advancing Type 1 Diabetes Management: Integrating Novel Therapies, Technologies, and Adjunctive Approaches.","In type 1 diabetes, a condition that necessitates lifelong exogenous insulin replacement, there is heavy reliance on technology-assisted insulin delivery and glucose monitoring. Yet, people living with type 1 diabetes still face dysglycemia, weight gain, vascular complications, ketoacidosis and severe hypoglycemia, and psychological distress. Cardiovascular and kidney disease remain the leading causes of morbidity and mortality, yet traditional risk factors (smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, hyperglycemia) incompletely explain this excess burden. Emerging evidence highlights the role of insulin resistance, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction exacerbated by current subcutaneous insulin therapies in type 1 diabetes, independent of overweight/obesity status. This has fueled interest in addressing metabolic challenges in type 1 diabetes through novel insulin analogs, adjunctive noninsulin therapies, and integrated technologies. Our review explores the potential synergy between technologies and adjunctive therapeutics to address unique physiologic drivers of metabolic dysfunction in type 1 diabetes. Innovations such as multihormonal systems, dynamic glucose and ketone monitoring, and automated insulin titration hold promise. However, leveraging emerging insights from nutrient-stimulated hormone-based therapies and other drug classes such as insulin-sensitizing agents and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors could pave the way for designing combination type 1 diabetes-specific therapies. Large, placebo-controlled trials are needed to progress the field toward use of combination therapies that reduce metabolic and vascular complications and ease patient burden in type 1 diabetes.",Diabetes Management
40866600,Diabetes trends and determinants among Thai adults from 2004 to 2020.,"The global prevalence of diabetes is increasing rapidly, with particular concern for undiagnosed, uncontrolled, and untreated diabetes. This study used data from the Thai National Health Examination Surveys in 2004, 2009, 2014, and 2020 to estimate the overall prevalence and trends of diabetes, diagnosed, treated, and controlled diabetes. We also used multivariable logistic regression models to examine the factors related to the prevalence of diabetes, as well as diagnosed, treated, and controlled diabetes, in the 2020 survey cycle. Following the global trends, age- and sex-standardized prevalence of diabetes in Thailand increased from 7.5% (95%CI: 6.5, 8.5) in 2004 to 10.1% (95%CI: 9.0, 11.1) in 2020; only 62.8% (95%CI: 59.9, 65.8) were aware of their diagnosis, 42.9% (95%CI: 39.0, 46.9) were treated, and only 20.5% (95%CI: 17.8, 23.1) had controlled blood glucose levels. Individuals in younger age groups and lower socioeconomic status were more likely to be independently associated with unawareness, untreated, and uncontrolled diabetes. These findings underscore the importance of addressing the awareness, treatment, and control gaps in diabetes management in Thai adults.

40873447,Exploring the impact of artificial sweeteners on diabetes management and glycemic control.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM), a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by impaired glucose metabolism, has emerged as a significant global health challenge. Effective management of diabetes encompasses not only medical interventions but also lifestyle and dietary modifications. Artificial sweeteners (ASs), due to their low caloric content and minimal impact on blood glucose levels, offer promising potential as sugar substitutes for individuals aiming to manage glycemic control. Compounds such as aspartame, sucralose, and stevia mimic the sweetness of sugar without causing hyperglycemia, making them suitable for diabetic patients. This chapter explores the role of ASs in diabetes management, with a special focus on their mechanisms of action, including modulation of insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. An extensive review of preclinical and clinical studies evaluates the efficacy, safety, and long-term effects of ASs in glycemic control, highlighting their ability to reduce caloric intake, promote satiety, and support glycemic control and insulin sensitivity in individuals with diabetes. Emerging evidence suggests that ASs may influence gut microbiota, potentially affecting metabolic outcomes and insulin sensitivity, thus presenting opportunities for personalized interventions. Despite their benefits, awareness of potential risks, such as altered taste perception and over-reliance on ASs, is crucial. Integrating ASs within a broader lifestyle approach, comprising regular exercise and balanced nutrition, ensures optimal outcomes in diabetes management. This chapter emphasizes the importance of precision medicine in tailoring AS use to individual metabolic responses, underscoring its role as an adjunct to comprehensive diabetes care strategies.",Diabetes Management

40863564,Behavioural Change Interventions for Preventing Periodontal Disease in Older Adults: A Literature Review.,"Periodontal disease is a common and serious oral disease among older adults. As the global older population increases, preventing periodontal disease is vital for healthy ageing. Poor oral hygiene, uncontrolled diabetes, and smoking are key risk factors of periodontal disease. Improving oral hygiene, diabetes management, and quitting smoking are essential health behavioural change interventions to manage periodontal disease. The objective of this study is to review the prevention of periodontal disease among older adults through health behavioural change interventions. Effective strategies to improve oral hygiene include personalised education on proper brushing and interdental cleaning. Educating caregivers is equally important as they supervise care-dependent older adults to maintain oral health. For those with diabetes, physical activity improves glycated haemoglobin levels and clinical periodontal parameters by reducing reactive oxygen species and systemic inflammation. Smoking cessation could be achieved through a multi-faceted approach. Effective smoking cessation combines brief interventions with intensive behavioural/pharmacological support for long-term success, especially in highly dependent individuals. Tailored strategies for older adults, integrated care, and expanded research improve outcomes and health equity in ageing populations. In conclusion, health behavioural change interventions are non-invasive preventive measures that include oral hygiene reinforcement, diabetic management, and smoking cessation. Prioritising these interventions empowers older adults to maintain oral health, reducing disease burden and enhancing overall well-being for healthy ageing.",Diabetes Management

40859782,Diabetes Mellitus and Infectious Diseases: Current Evidence and Clinical Implications.,"Diabetes mellitus predisposes individuals to a broad spectrum of infections. People with diabetes face a 1.5- to 4-fold increased risk of both common and severe infections, and infections remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Chronic hyperglycemia impairs neutrophil chemotaxis, oxidative burst, and complement activation, while vascular insufficiency and neuropathy compromise tissue perfusion and barrier integrity. These defects, together with altered skin, mucosal, and gut microbiota, influence the marked susceptibility to urinary tract infections (especially renal abscess and emphysematous pyelonephritis), osteomyelitis, diabetic foot infections, pneumonia (including influenza), tuberculosis, skin and soft tissue infections, and lifethreatening syndromes such as emphysematous cholecystitis and rhino-orbital mucormycosis that are almost exclusive to people with diabetes. Outcomes from infections are worse in diabetes. Although the core therapeutic principles align with those for patients without diabetes, management should be individualized. Glycemic control should balance infection risk and hypoglycemia; antimicrobial dosing should account for renal function and drug interactions; and strict antimicrobial stewardship is required.

Herein, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) metabolomics was employed to investigate the changes in serum metabolites of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats in response to pioglitazone treatment. Both untargeted and targeted analyses were conducted to identify and quantify the key metabolic perturbations. Multivariate analysis modeling such as principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and orthogonal projections to latent structures DA (OPLS-DA) revealed significant differences in the metabolic profiles among the diabetic, pioglitazone-treated, and control groups. A panel of 15 differentially altered metabolites was identified, of which a targeted quantification was performed of 6 key metabolites that were significantly modulated by pioglitazone treatment. These metabolites include two branched-chain amino acids (l-isoleucine, l-valine), two organic acids (lactic, beta-hydroxybutyric), and two fatty acids (palmitic, stearic). Interestingly, pathway analysis revealed the inability of pioglitazone to restore the levels of some metabolites, suggesting possible persistent metabolic alterations in diabetes even after treatment. This metabolic signature offers significant potential for clinical translation, serving as a biomarker panel for monitoring diabetes progression and therapeutic efficacy. Such comprehensive GC-MS metabolomics platform provides a robust analytical framework for accelerating diabetes drug discovery, enabling precise therapeutic monitoring, and facilitating personalized medicine approaches in diabetes management.",Diabetes Management

Health outcomes included clinical (HbA1C, fasting blood glucose, BMI) and psychological (diabetes management self-efficacy, food choice motives) measures.AnalysisHierarchical cluster analysis was used to identify profiles according to nutritional health and decision process. Welch's ANOVA were used to test their differences in health outcomes.ResultsFive profiles were identified: Cautious (healthy choice + slow reaction, 42.86%), Moderate (moderate healthy choice/reaction time, 28.57%), Well-Habit (healthy choice + fast reaction, 11.43%), Strained (unhealthy choice + slow reaction, 7.62%) and Impulsive (unhealthy choice + fast reaction, 9.52%). The Well-Habit Profile exhibited the best outcomes, including lower BMI, higher self-efficacy and healthier food choice motives. The Cautious Profile showed healthy choices but suboptimal self-efficacy. The Impulsive Profile presented a good self-efficacy, but the highest BMI and inadequate healthy choice motives.ConclusionThis study identified five food decision-making profiles for adults with T2DM and overweight/obesity, providing insights of considering both nutritional health and decision process as food choice features when conducting dietary interventions.

40851275,Light-Mediated Insulin and Amylin Secretion: Influence of Irradiation Parameters in Optogenetically Modified Mouse-Pancreatic β Cells.,"Optogenetics offers a promising avenue for controlled insulin secretion in diabetes management using genetically modified cells. However, the influence of irradiation parameters on the co-secreted hormone amylin remains largely unexplored. This study examined how blue light power densities (50, 100, and 200 mW/cm2) under continuous and intermittent exposure affect hormonal secretion in channelrhodopsin-2 expressing mouse β cells. Results showed that 10 s of continuous exposure at 50 mW/cm2 increased insulin and amylin secretion by ~25% and 40%, respectively. Introducing intermittent dark intervals further enhanced secretion by ~35% for insulin and 70% for amylin at 50 and 100 mW/cm2 respectively, correlating with intracellular calcium changes. Notably, light modulated the amylin-to-insulin molar ratio, peaking with a 34% increase during 5 s 'on'-10s 'off' exposure at 100 mW/cm2. This study provides the first evidence that light irradiation parameters can differentially influence hormonal secretion from engineered cells, offering a potential for tailored cell-based diabetes therapies.",Diabetes Management

40847986,Global Burden of Severe Heart Failure Attributable to Chronic Kidney Disease in Diabetes Populations: A Systematic Analysis of the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.,"Aims/Background Severe heart failure (SHF) secondary to chronic kidney disease (CKD) in type 1/2 diabetes mellitus (T1/T2DM) patients presents a critical global health challenge. Leveraging data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021, we analyse epidemiological trends (1990-2021) and project disease trajectories to 2040, focusing on sociodemographic disparities and metabolic determinants. Methods Utilising GBD 2021 data, the estimated prevalence and years lived with disability (YLDs) values were extracted for SHF-CKD-T1/T2DM, along with their corresponding 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). The trend in SHF-CKD-T1/T2DM burden between 1990 and 2021 was evaluated from both a global and local perspective. Subgroup analysis was employed to examine the burden of SHF-CKD-T1/T2DM across various subpopulations. Additionally, decomposition analysis was used to assess the contributions of population size, age structure, and epidemiological changes to SHF-CKD-T1/T2DM burden. The Bayesian Age-Period-Cohort (BAPC) model and the Nordpred model projected the burden through 2040. Results In 2021, the prevalence of SHF-CKD-T1DM was 5723 (95% UI: 4397 to 7284) and SHF-CKD-T2DM was 122,404 (95% UI: 89,920 to 169,580). The age-standardised years lived with disability (YLDs) rates for SHF-CKD-T1DM in 2021 exhibited a significant increase to 0.012 (95% UI: 0.008 to 0.019), while YLDs rates for SHF-CKD-T2DM also showed a notable rise to 0.249 (95% UI: 0.146 to 0.394). The global burden of SHF-CKD-T1/T2DM showed variability across different sociodemographic index (SDI) regions. In 2021, the overall burden of SHF-CKD-T1/T2DM continued to increase, with age being a significant contributor. Similarly, SHF-CKD-T1/T2DM burden exhibited gender-specific variability. Decomposition analysis indicated that epidemiological changes were the primary contributors to the global burden of prevalence and YLDs associated with SHF-CKD-T1/T2DM. It is projected that by 2040, the trends in prevalence and YLDs will stabilise; however, they are expected to continue rising. Conclusion The increasing burden of SHF-CKD-T1/T2DM is driven by epidemiological transitions, population growth, and regional disparities. Although growth rates have decelerated, the rising number of cases highlights the urgent need for targeted prevention and early intervention strategies in high-risk populations. To alleviate this burden, it is essential to address metabolic determinants, improve healthcare access in regions with high prevalence, expand diabetes treatment coverage in low-SDI regions, and incorporate cardiorenal risk stratification into diabetes management frameworks.",Diabetes Management

Consensus statements on the treatment of chronic wounds and acute wounds have been developed and published previously. The current publication on diabetic wounds represents the next step in this process. Diabetic wounds constitute a major problem. Population-based and meta-analytic studies indicate that the presence of foot wounds in patients with diabetes increases their mortality risk by more than twofold. The management of diabetic wounds requires consistent and evidence-driven intervention to achieve optimal clinical outcomes. This consensus statement provides the clinician with the necessary foundational approaches to the causes, diagnosis, and therapeutic management of diabetic wounds. Presented in a structured format, this is a useful guide for clinicians and learners in all patient care settings. Recent Advances: Continuous glucose monitoring and other new tools have facilitated better diabetes management and the management of associated wounds. Diabetic limb salvage should focus on achieving and optimizing function for the patient with diabetes rather than preserving limb tissue at all costs. Critical Issues: Successful management of diabetic wounds requires a multidisciplinary approach encompassing comprehensive assessment, timely intervention, and collaborative care by the wound clinician with providers who can address critical aspects to achieve healing, including careful management of blood glucose levels, optimization of off-loading and physical therapy, assessment and treatment of limb ischemia, control and prevention of wound infection, and optimal pain management.

Mathurameha (MT), a polyherbal preparation, has been historically used for its antidiabetic potential. However, its molecular mechanisms remain largely unexplored. FrE exhibited potent α-glucosidase inhibition (IC₅₀ 0.3 µg/mL) and significantly enhanced glucose uptake in L6 myotubes (3.67 ± 0.23-fold) and 3T3-L1 adipocytes (IC₅₀ 6.78 µg/mL). It also stimulated insulin secretion (1.42-fold), comparable to metformin (1.46-fold), and protected INS-1 pancreatic β-cells from H₂O₂-induced apoptosis (30.65 ± 3.54%) through partial caspase-3 inhibition. LC-MS-QTOF analysis identified 73 metabolites, including ellagic acid, kushenol A, gallic acid, arctiin, neoandrographolide, astilbin, paenol, muricatacin, coumarrayin, and zingerone.

Fifty-four youths participated (average age 13.5 years). The CHORES survey evaluated chore participation, the STARx questionnaire assessed health care transition readiness, and the Perceived Diabetes Self-Management Scale (PDSMS) assessed self-efficacy. Results showed that involvement in chores was positively correlated with transition readiness scores (r = .404, p < .05) and important subdomains of transition, namely self-management and provider communication. Mediation analysis found that self-efficacy significantly influenced the link between chores and transition readiness. This suggests that when adolescents assume more household responsibilities, they may develop greater confidence in managing their diabetes, which in turn enhances their readiness for the health care transition. Encouraging chores participation can improve transition readiness directly and indirectly, through self-efficacy.

40814615,Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Summit Recommendations on Implementation of Diabetes Management in CKD: From Primary to Data-Driven Collaborative Care.,"Type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are preventable and treatable. Their silent and progressive clinical course calls for structured assessment with timely feedback to patients and care providers for activating decision-making. Apart from CKD, patients with diabetes can have complications affecting multiple organs, notably the cardiovascular system, eyes, and feet. International practice guidelines recommend annual assessment of the eyes, feet, blood, and urine to detect silent complications and measure cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) risk factors to ensure early intervention, including treatment to multiple targets and use of organ-protective drugs. In this report, we highlight the barriers and gaps in the implementation of practice guidelines in managing diabetes in CKD with proposed solutions to overcome such barriers. By improving the practice environment and workflow, nurses can be trained to perform protocol-guided evaluation under medical supervision. The systematic data collection enables physicians to make timely decisions, including drug prescriptions and referrals to other specialists to promote collaborative care, whereas nurses can use the personalized data to empower patient self-management and improve health literacy. This ongoing data collection will form a register to align payers, providers, and patients in delivering data-driven and value-based care with the creation of real-world evidence to verify treatment effectiveness and identify care gaps while providing on-the-job training.

The Box-Behnken design (BBD) was used to optimize the three independent variables comprising of 17 experimental runs, with the experiments randomly arranged to minimize the effects of unexpected variation in the observed dependent variables {extraction yield, total phenolic content (TPC), and total flavonoid content (TFC)} due to systematic errors. The speed (X1, 100, 150 and 200 rpm), solvent volume (X2, 100 and 150 and 200 mL), and extraction time (X3, 2, 5 and 100 h) at 3-levels (high and low coded levels) were used to evaluate BBD of RSM. Results showed that the maximum value of yield, TPC and TFC in leaves ethanol extracts (LEE); flower ethanol extract (FEE), and whole plant ethanol extracts (WPEE) were observed at the following extraction conditions: A X1 of 150 rpm, X2 of 200 mL and X3 at 8 h. The minimum values were observed at an X1 of 150 rpm, X2 of 100 mL and X3 of 2 h. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the interaction effects of independent factors showed that X2 and X3 significantly positively influenced the response variables. These values closely matched the predicted yield, TPC and TFC. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis reveals that hydroxybenzoic acid, p-coumaric acid, gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, and salicylic acid, are the major secondary metabolites in the extracts. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis showed the presence of different compounds such as thiazole, 2-ethylacridine, silicic acid, arsenous acid, 3,5-ethanoquinolin-10-one, and hexahydropyridine. All these identified compounds exhibit a wide range of various biological potential, including anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic and anti-bacterial activities. The highest α-amylase inhibitory potential IC50 (53.33 ± 0.21 µg/mL), and α-glucosidase inhibitory potential IC50 (51.07 ± 0.17 µg/mL) were shown by LEE extracts. The study concludes that LEE extracts may have anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antioxidant, hepatoprotective, and nephroprotective potential, suggesting potential for further investigation in diabetes management.",Diabetes Management

A growing number of patients receiving these therapies are presenting for gynecologic surgery. This narrative review summarizes current evidence on GLP-1 RAs, including their mechanisms of action, clinical benefits, and perioperative considerations, with particular attention to their effects on gastric emptying and the associated risk of aspiration. Early recommendations advised routine discontinuation of GLP-1 RAs before surgery because of theoretical concerns about delayed gastric emptying. However, recent multisociety guidance supports continued use for most patients, with individualized risk assessment and perioperative strategies such as preoperative liquid diets for those at higher risk. These evolving recommendations reflect a shift toward balancing the metabolic and weight loss benefits of GLP-1 RAs with perioperative safety considerations. As clinical experience with these agents grows, ongoing research and multidisciplinary collaboration remain essential to ensure optimal outcomes for patients undergoing gynecologic surgery.",Diabetes Management
40811294,Privacy Preserved Blood Glucose Level Cross-Prediction: An Asynchronous Decentralized Federated Learning Approach.,"Newly diagnosed Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) patients often struggle to obtain effective Blood Glucose (BG) prediction models due to the lack of sufficient BG data from Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM), presenting a significant ""cold start"" problem in patient care. Utilizing population models to address this challenge is a potential solution, but collecting patient data for training population models in a privacy-conscious manner is challenging, especially given that such data is often stored on personal devices. Considering the privacy protection and addressing the ""cold start"" problem in diabetes care, we propose ""GluADFL"", blood Glucose prediction by Asynchronous Decentralized Federated Learning. We compared GluADFL with eight baseline methods using four distinct T1D datasets, comprising 298 participants, which demonstrated its superior performance in accurately predicting BG levels for cross-patient analysis. Furthermore, patients' data might be stored and shared across various communication networks in GluADFL, ranging from highly interconnected (e.g., random, performs the best among others) to more structured topologies (e.g., cluster and ring), suitable for various social networks. The asynchronous training framework supports flexible participation. By adjusting the ratios of inactive participants, we found it remains stable if less than 70% are inactive. Our results confirm that GluADFL offers a practical, privacy-preserved solution for BG prediction in T1D, significantly enhancing the quality of diabetes management.",Diabetes Management

In diabetes, disruption of this axis, mediated by gut microbiota dysbiosis, impaired intestinal barrier function, and pro-inflammatory signaling, contributes significantly to insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and systemic metabolic dysfunction. This review explores the underlying mechanisms by which microbial alterations, increased gut permeability, and inflammatory pathways influence hepatic insulin resistance and glucose metabolism. In addition to established mechanisms, emerging pathways involving neuroendocrine circuits, microbial metabolites, and immune mediators are discussed, offering deeper insight into gut-liver interactions in metabolic disease. The review also outlines therapeutic strategies targeting the gut-liver axis, including microbiota modulation, barrier function enhancement, and anti-inflammatory interventions, emphasizing their potential in advancing diabetes management. A conceptual framework is proposed to integrate these components into a precision medicine approach for metabolic regulation. Key challenges in clinical translation, including patient heterogeneity and the absence of reliable biomarkers to guide treatment decisions are also discussed to inform future research. By linking mechanistic understanding with therapeutic innovation, the review highlights the gut-liver axis as a promising target for personalized diabetes care.",Diabetes Management

40807540,Enhancement of Phytochemicals and Antioxidant Activity of Thai Fermented Soybean Using Box-Behnken Design Guided Microwave-Assisted Extraction.,"Thai fermented soybeans (TFSs) contain phytochemicals with anti-diabetic benefits. In this study, an initial non-optimized TFS extract (TFSE) was prepared using a conventional triplicate 80% ethanol extraction method and evaluated for its biological activity. TFSE effectively reversed TNF-α-induced insulin resistance in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by enhancing insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, indicating anti-diabetic potential. TFSE also upregulated the phosphorylation of AKT (a key insulin signaling mediator) and the expression of adipogenic proteins (PPARγ, CEBPα) in TNF-α-exposed 3T3-L1, suggesting the mitigation of adipocyte dysfunction; however, the results did not reach statistical significance. The conventional extraction process was labor-intensive and time-consuming, and to enhance extraction efficiency and bioactivity, the process was subsequently optimized using environmentally friendly microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) in combination with the Box-Behnken design (BBD) and response surface methodology (RSM). The optimized extract (O-TFSE) was obtained over a significantly shorter extraction time and exhibited higher levels of total flavonoids and antioxidant activity in comparison to TFSE, while showing reduced levels of isoflavones (daidzein, genistein, and glycitein) in relation to TFSE. Interestingly, O-TFSE retained similar efficacy in reversing TNF-α-induced insulin resistance and demonstrated significantly stronger α-glucosidase and α-amylase inhibitory activities, indicating its enhanced potential for diabetes management. These results support the use of MAE as an efficient method for extracting functional compounds from TFS for functional foods targeting insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus.",Diabetes Management
40807234,One-Pot Synthesis of Phenylboronic Acid-Based Microgels for Tunable Gate of Glucose-Responsive Insulin Release at Physiological pH.,"Glucose-responsive insulin delivery systems that effectively regulate insulin retention and release in response to real-time fluctuation of glucose levels are highly desirable for diabetes care with minimized risk of hypoglycemia. Herein, we report a class of glucose-sensitive copolymer microgels, prepared from a simple one-pot precipitation copolymerization of 4-vinylphenylboronic acid (VPBA), 2-(dimethylamino) ethyl acrylate (DMAEA), and oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (Mw = 300, MEO5MA), for gated glucose-responsive insulin release within the physiologically desirable glucose level range. The composition of the p(VPBA-DMAEA-MEO5MA) copolymer microgels were analyzed using NMR and FTIR spectra. The cis-diols of glucose can reversibly bind with the -B(OH)2 groups of the VPBA component in the microgels, resulting in the formation of negatively charged boronate esters that induce the volume phase transition of the microgels. The DMAEA component is incorporated to reduce the pKa of VPBA, thus improving the glucose sensitivity of the microgels at physiological pH. The neutral hydrophilic MEO5MA component is used to tune the onset of the glucose responsiveness of the microgels to the physiologically desirable levels. The more the MEO5MA component copolymerized in the microgels, the greater the glucose concentration required to initiate the swelling of the microgels to trigger the release of insulin. When the onset of the glucose response was tuned to 4-5 mM, the copolymer microgels retained insulin effectively in the hypo-/normo-glycemic range but also released insulin efficiently in response to the elevation of glucose levels in the hyperglycemic range, which is essential for diabetes management. The copolymer microgels display no cytotoxicity in vitro.",Diabetes Management

This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the effects of TRE on glycemic outcomes by analyzing eight randomized controlled trials involving 312 participants with type 2 diabetes or impaired fasting glucose. Meta-analyses of six eligible studies demonstrated that TRE significantly reduced fasting glucose (mean difference [MD]: -0.74 mmol/L; 95% CI: -1.13 to -0.36) and glycated hemoglobin (ΔHbA1c) (MD: -0.11%; 95% CI: -0.15 to -0.07) and increased time in range (TIR) for blood glucose (MD: +10.51%; 95% CI: 6.81 to 14.21). Improvements in fasting glucose and HbA1c were modest but consistent, while the increase in TIR showed no between-study heterogeneity, suggesting a robust and reproducible benefit of TRE on glycemic stability. These findings support the clinical feasibility and effectiveness of TRE as a dietary intervention in diabetes management. However, further high-quality trials with standardized protocols and longer follow-up are needed to confirm long-term efficacy and inform guidelines.",Diabetes Management

Healthcare professionals (HCPs) may benefit from clear and practical guidance on translating the use of icodec from a controlled clinical trial setting into real-world clinical practice to ensure its appropriate implementation. Here, we primarily review the available evidence for icodec in T2D to provide evidence-based clinical recommendations and expert opinions to guide the use of icodec in a clinical setting. The pharmacology of icodec is summarized, along with an overview of the results from the ONWARDS 1-6 clinical trials (NCT04460885, NCT04770532, NCT04795531, NCT04880850, NCT04760626, NCT04848480). Key guidance on the practical use of icodec, including treatment initiation, switching to icodec from a once- or twice-daily basal insulin, switching from icodec back to a daily basal insulin, and dose titration, is provided. Icodec usage in special populations and practical situations (e.g., elderly and pediatric individuals, hepatic and renal impairment, hospitalized individuals, and those who are pregnant or planning pregnancy) is discussed. Considerations for glucose monitoring and management, as well as co-administration of icodec with other non-insulin glucose-lowering medications, are provided. Finally, we also briefly summarize the available evidence on icodec use in individuals with T1D, although the primary focus of this review is on its use in T2D.

Methods A retrospective review of the electronic medical records of diabetic patients registered during the period August 2022 to July 2024 at King Fahad Specialist Hospital (KFSH) in Qassim was conducted. The association between follow-up care and various metabolic outcomes was determined by applying the chi-square test and Fisher's exact test. SPSS software version 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, US) was used for data analysis. Results The study included 286 patients with diabetes; 75.2% of them had glycemic control issues (HbA1c ≥ 7%), 56.3% of patients saw a doctor just once during the study period, and only 11.9% of patients received routine follow-up. Glycemic control and follow-up frequency were found to be significantly associated (χ² = 15.892, p < 0.001), with patients who received regular follow-up showing better results. Furthermore, poor glycemic control was significantly associated with low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (p = 0.015), but no significant associations were found with other lipid parameters. Conclusions In diabetic patients, better glycemic control has a direct relationship with regular follow-up care. These results emphasize the importance of organized, ongoing care in maximizing diabetes management as well as the inclusion of follow-up frequency into regular clinical practice.",Diabetes Management

This study aimed to determine prevalence and independent predictors of hypomagnesemia among Yemeni adults with T2DM. A retrospective analysis was conducted among 487 adults with T2DM attending Al-Raffa Center in Ibb, Yemen, from 2018 to 2023. Demographic, clinical, and biochemical parameters-including serum magnesium (Mg), HbA1c, and lipid profiles-were evaluated. Hypomagnesemia was defined as serum Mg < 1.6 mg/dL. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify independent predictors. The cohort had a mean age of 48.3 ± 15.3 years, with 63.4% female participants. Hypomagnesemia was present in 37.2% of patients. Poor glycemic control (HbA1c ≥7%) and LDL ≥100 mg/dL were observed in 42.3%, and 42.1%, respectively. In univariate analysis, hypomagnesemia was significantly associated with older age, female sex, obesity (BMI ≥25 kg/m2), hypertension, diabetes duration ≥5 years, poor glycemic control, khat chewing, elevated LDL, low HDL, and hypertriglyceridemia (all P < .05). Multivariate regression identified obesity (adjusted OR [aOR] 9.32, 95% CI 4.97-18.06), HbA1c ≥7% (aOR 2.85, 95% CI 1.80-4.52), female sex (aOR 1.85, 95% CI 1.20-2.85), hypertension (aOR 1.58, 95% CI 1.02-2.45), diabetes duration ≥5 years (aOR 1.90, 95% CI 1.20-3.00), and LDL ≥100 mg/dL (aOR 1.60, 95% CI 1.02-2.50) as independent predictors. A significant interaction was observed between obesity and poor glycemic control (aOR 3.25, P < .001). The final model demonstrated excellent discrimination (AUC-ROC = 0.86). Hypomagnesemia is highly prevalent among Yemeni adults with T2DM and is independently associated with female sex, obesity, poor glycemic control, hypertension, longer diabetes duration, and elevated LDL. The synergistic effect of obesity and poor glycemic control identifies a particularly high-risk subgroup. Routine assessment of serum Mg should be considered in diabetes management, especially for women and individuals with coexisting obesity and hyperglycemia in resource-limited settings.",Diabetes Management

While both T2D and AD are linked to neurodegeneration, the extent to which their patterns of brain atrophy overlap remain unclear.ObjectiveTo assess the similarities and differences in cortical atrophy patterns among individuals with controlled and uncontrolled T2D, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD.MethodsStructural magnetic resonance imaging data from the UK Biobank (UKBB) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were analyzed. Participants aged 55 and older were selected. Linear regression models were applied to generate cortical thickness maps for each group, controlling for age and sex. Group comparisons were conducted using permutation-based tests accounting for spatial autocorrelation.ResultsThe study included 175 individuals with T2D (86 uncontrolled, 89 controlled) and 127 healthy controls without diabetes (HC) from UKBB, 334 individuals with MCI, 119 with AD and 315 cognitively healthy (CH) from ADNI. Uncontrolled T2D was associated with significant cortical atrophy in specific brain regions, with partial overlap in neurodegeneration patterns observed in MCI and AD. However, correlations between the cortical thinning patterns were weak and non-significant, suggesting distinct trajectories. Controlled T2D showed no significant cortical thinning, supporting the potential neuroprotective effects of glycemic control.ConclusionsUncontrolled T2D is linked to region-specific cortical atrophy that partially overlaps with MCI and AD but follows an independent neurodegenerative trajectory.

40782191,Effects of Probiotic and Synbiotic Supplementation on Glycemic Indices in Adult Individuals with Prediabetes and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Grade-Assessed Systematic Review and Dose-Response Meta-analysis of RCTs.,"Probiotic and synbiotic supplementation has garnered attention for its potential to modulate metabolic parameters, including glycemic control, in individuals with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effectiveness of these supplements on glycemic indices, synthesizing evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with grade-assessed methodologies. A comprehensive search of scientific databases was conducted from inception through January 2025 to identify RCTs assessing the effects of probiotic and synbiotic supplementation on glycemic indices, including fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin (FI), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Eligible studies were screened; relevant data were extracted, and the quality of evidence was evaluated using the GRADE approach. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA to generate pooled results. The pooled analysis of 48 RCTs demonstrated that probiotics and synbiotics supplementation significantly decreased FBG (WMD: - 7.00 mg/dL), FI (WMD: - 1.72 µIU/mL), HbA1c levels (WMD: - 0.34%), and HOMA-IR (WMD: - 0.91), with a substantial heterogeneity across all outcomes (p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses indicated reductions in FBG, FI, HbA1c, and HOMA-IR across varying baseline characteristics, including glycemic levels, trial durations, and participant health status. Both probiotics and synbiotics were effective, with notable benefits for patients with T2DM, longer intervention durations, and higher baseline BMI. Meta-regression and dose-response analyses revealed no significant association between the duration of probiotic and synbiotic supplementation and changes in glycemic indices. Probiotic and synbiotic supplements significantly reduce FBG, FI, HbA1c, and HOMA-IR, leading to improvements in glycemic markers in individuals with prediabetes and T2DM. These supplements can be used as effective adjunctive strategies to enhance glycemic control, highlighting the promising role of gut microbiota modulation in diabetes management.",Diabetes Management

Although walking is widely recommended as an effective form of exercise for diabetes management, many patients experience difficulty maintaining exercise routines due to fatigue. We hypothesized that patients with type 2 diabetes who experience fatigue during exercise would exhibit gait abnormalities that contribute to fatigue, such as abnormal increases or decreases in gait acceleration, particularly reduced regularity in vertical acceleration. Methods In this cross-sectional study, we recruited 50 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (mean age: 64.9 ± 12.0 years; BMI: 25.3 ± 4.6 kg/m²; 32 males and 18 females; HbA1c: 10.0 ± 2.2%) who were admitted to two hospitals in Japan for glycemic control between April 2020 and March 2021. Gait parameters were measured using a triaxial accelerometer during a 16-meter free walking test. Results Participants were divided into fatigue (n = 29; age: 60.7 ± 12.4 years; BMI: 26.4 ± 4.8 kg/m²) and no-fatigue (n=21; age: 70.8 ± 9.1 years; BMI: 23.8 ± 4.0 kg/m²) groups based on the Exercise Benefits and Barriers Scale. No significant differences were observed in the root mean square (RMS) or RMS ratio between the groups. Statistical analyses were conducted following normality confirmation using the Shapiro-Wilk test. The unpaired t-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were applied to normally and non-normally distributed data, respectively, and categorical variables were compared using the chi-square test. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was also performed. The vertical autocorrelation coefficient (ACVT), representing gait regularity, was significantly lower in the fatigue group compared to the no-fatigue group (p=0.044; CI: -0.05 to 0.00). Activity energy expenditure (AEE), calculated based on acceleration, BMI, and sex as a proxy for oxygen consumption, was significantly higher in the fatigue group (p=0.039; CI: 0.03 to 0.45). Multivariate analysis identified age (p=0.008; OR=0.916; CI: 0.84 to 0.98) and ACVT (p=0.038; OR=0.16; CI: 0.02 to 0.90) as significant factors.

40777704,Trends in Diabetic Medication Use and Hypoglycemia Incidence Among Older Adults in Japan: A Retrospective Observational Study and a 10-Year Analysis Based on Level of Care Need Using Linked Medical and Long-Term Care Data.,"Background In Japan, the prevalence of diabetes among those aged 75 years and older is increasing with an aging population. The main goal of diabetes care is to prevent complications (such as diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy, and arteriosclerotic disease) while maintaining the quality of life. However, in older adults, glycemic targets must be individualized to avoid hypoglycemia, especially with medications, including sulfonylureas (SUs), glinides (GLs), and insulin, which pose a high risk of hypoglycemia. This study aimed to investigate the prescription trends of diabetes medications and the incidence of hypoglycemia among older diabetic patients aged 75 and above in Japan, stratified by their level of care need. This study analyzed 22,070-38,001 outpatients aged ≥75 years, assessing medication trends and hypoglycemia incidence (0.594% in 2013 to 0.316% in 2022). Methods This was a retrospective, observational study. Data were obtained from the Kokuho Database in Nara Prefecture (Nara KDB), linking medical and long-term care insurance records. This study included outpatients aged 75 and above with diabetes (excluding type 1) from 2013 to 2022. Patients were grouped as having care needs (HCN) or no care needs (NCN). The proportion of prescriptions for diabetes medications and hypoglycemia requiring intravenous glucose was annually assessed. Results From 2013 to 2022, the proportion of prescriptions for sulfonylureas (from 40.6% (N = 8,958) to 18.7% (N = 7,113)), intermediate-acting insulins (IIs) (from 8.17% (N = 1,804) to 1.79% (N = 681)), and rapid-acting insulins (RIs) (from 10.6% (N = 2,334) to 6.38% (N =2,424)) declined, similar to the incidence of hypoglycemia (from 0.594% (N = 131) to 0.316% (N = 120)). The incidence of hypoglycemia declined overall (0.594% to 0.316%), but that in HCN rose to 0.770% in 2022. The decrease in the incidence of hypoglycemia between 2013 and 2022 was statistically significant (p < 0.001). The number of long-acting insulin (LI) (from 5.66% (N = 1,250) to 8.13% (N = 3,091)) and glinide (from 4.78% (N = 1,055) to 5.87% (N = 2,231)) prescriptions increased. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4Is) (from 56.8% (N = 12,540) to 72.6% (N = 27,573)) were the most commonly prescribed drugs. HCN consistently showed a higher proportion of hypoglycemia (from 1.25% (N = 54) to 0.824% (N = 43)) than NCN (from 0.434% (N = 77) to 0.235% (N = 77)). Conclusion Diabetes management in older patients in Japan has improved, with a continuing decline in the incidence of hypoglycemia. However, older adults with higher care needs remain more vulnerable to hypoglycemia, likely due to greater frailty and higher insulin use. This finding suggests the need for further individualized treatment strategies and close monitoring.",Diabetes Management

40775522,Continuous insulin monitoring using an antibody-protecting zwitterionic microneedle patch.,"Continuous monitoring of protein and molecular biomarkers is essential for personalized disease tracking, but approaches for in vivo sensing are limited. Monitoring insulin, a peptide hormone, is an unmet need given the importance of this molecule in managing diabetes. Here we report a patch-based system with integrated electrochemical sensors that enables monitoring of insulin levels on an ongoing basis. We report a novel zwitterionic-based hydrogel microneedle patch with integrated molecular pendulum sensors that can measure insulin levels in the interstitial fluid of rats with type 1 diabetes. Our study demonstrates that the zwitterionic poly(carboxybetaine)-based microneedle patch stabilizes the antibody-based recognition elements, allowing them to withstand UV-induced crosslinking during patch fabrication and gamma-irradiation, often required for FDA-standard sterilization. We also investigate the impact of disrupted circadian rhythm on insulin levels, revealing circadian-dependent alterations in insulin absorption efficiency and distribution within the interstitial fluid and plasma. This platform not only enhances our understanding of in vivo insulin behaviour but also holds promise for personalized treatment strategies in diabetes management.",Diabetes Management

While significant efforts have been made to develop algorithms that assist PwT1D in managing blood glucose more effectively, access to automated insulin delivery (AID) systems remains highly variable across the world. Moreover, there is a lack of publicly available, comprehensive datasets necessary for developing algorithms to support scenarios where AID systems revert to manual mode. This study addresses this gap by providing a detailed, multimodal dataset encompassing five key aspects: blood glucose levels; basal and bolus insulin dosages; nutritional intake (carbohydrates, protein, fat, and fibre content); physical activity (step count, active calories, distance covered, MET, and intensity level); and sleep patterns. The dataset includes longitudinal (3-month) real-world data collected from 17 PwT1D participants. By making this resource available, the study aims to advance algorithm development and improve diabetes management, particularly in settings where AID technology is less accessible.",Diabetes Management

While continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the standard treatment, mandibular advancement devices (MADs) offer an alternative. This substudy of a randomized trial compared the effectiveness of MADs versus CPAP on 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (BP), sleep-related quality of life, myocardial remodeling, ambulatory heart rhythm, and biomarkers in severe OSA. A total of 144 participants were randomized to MAD (n = 73) or CPAP (n = 71) for 12 mo. Median nightly usage was 5.4 (2.9-6.5) h for the MAD group (≥6 h/night: 56.1%) and 4.9 (4.0-6.0) h for the CPAP group (≥6 h/night: 28.3%). The apnea-hypopnea index at baseline and 6 mo was 44.0 (37.6-59.2) and 20.9 (11.7-31.9) events/h in the MAD group and 50.7 (40.7-59.8) and 2.1 (1.2-3.4) events/h in the CPAP group, respectively. MAD treatment reduced asleep mean BP (-4.7 mm Hg, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -8.3 to -4.0, P = 0.015), asleep systolic BP (-2.0 mm Hg, 95% CI: -10.0 to -4.0, P = 0.047), and asleep diastolic BP (-4.0 mm Hg, 95% CI: -9.0 to -3.0, P = 0.007), whereas CPAP showed no significant changes. The between-group differences favored MAD in asleep mean BP (-3.70 mm Hg, 95% CI: -7.40 to 0.00, P = 0.050) and asleep systolic BP (-4.78 mm Hg, 95% CI: -9.51 to 0.04, P = 0.048). Both improved sleep-related quality of life, although CPAP had a slightly greater effect on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (Δ1.63, 95% CI: 0.45 to 2.81, P = 0.007). No significant changes were observed in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging parameters, ambulatory heart rhythm, or biomarkers. Adverse effects included jaw pain (14.8%) and teeth discomfort (8.2%) with MAD, whereas CPAP users reported dry mouth (50.8%), nasal congestion (23.0%), and air leakage (29.5%). In conclusion, these findings suggested MAD could be an acceptable and effective treatment for patients with severe OSA and hypertension. The study was registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04119999).",Cardiovascular Risk

40888118,Comprehensive management of chronic kidney disease in the old population.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global issue that raises inflammation and heightens the risk of progressing to advanced CKD, requiring renal replacement therapy. It also significantly increases the likelihood of cardiovascular and vascular diseases, hospitalizations, functional decline, and reduced quality of life, particularly in older adults. CKD prevalence rises with age, affecting 25-30% of older adults. Despite that, the fact is that CKD is underdiagnosed in this population. Diagnosing CKD in older patients is difficult because accurate tests are limited, common serum creatinine-based formulas depend on muscle mass (often low in this group), and age-related renal function decline further complicates assessment. Comprehensive management can help achieve therapeutic goals in the old population with CKD through assessments and care plans. This care includes a combination of lifestyle changes, cardiovascular risk factors control, the use of drugs with proven renal and cardiovascular benefits, as well as the adequate management of specific clinical conditions, including the general clinical comorbidities, renal-related conditions and recognition of geriatric syndromes, helping patients manage their condition and involving them in decisions about their care.

We aimed to determine whether pathological PSS, alone or in combination with global longitudinal strain (GLS), is a prognostic factor for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in patients with type 2 diabetes. We prospectively investigated 364 patients with type 2 diabetes aged 55-65 years in the CARDIPP study. All patients underwent echocardiography between 2005 and 2009. PSS, measured by speckle tracking echocardiography, was defined as myocardial contraction after aortic valve closure. Pathological PSS was defined as a post-systolic index > 5% and was calculated as follows: [(maximum longitudinal strain - peak systolic longitudinal strain)/(maximum longitudinal strain)]. The endpoint was any MACE, defined as hospitalization or death due to heart failure, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Cox proportional hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated and adjusted for sex, age, body mass index, hypertension, smoking, previous cardiovascular events, and HbA1c level.

40887408,Could Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor antagonists be used to treat obstructive sleep apnoea in children and adolescents with obesity?,"Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and obesity may co-exist in children and adolescents. Childhood obesity tends to persist into adulthood. Sustained weight loss is recommended for obesity and OSA but may be very difficult to achieve and maintain in the real world. The need to provide effective and integrated solutions for the constellation of associated pro-inflammatory and mechanical complications of obesity including obstructive sleep apnoea, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes mellitus is obvious. Sleep laboratories cannot meet the demand for diagnostic polysomnograms and under resourced paediatric obesity clinics limit themselves to treating those with severe obesity. Importantly, readily accessible resources, such as community-based dietitians and other allied health professionals, are both scarce and overwhelmed by demands for their services. The result is that many families who need assistance, especially those with socio-economic disadvantage and those with neurodiverse children, are unable to access treatments in a timely and equitable manner. In adults, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have been demonstrated to reduce body weight by up to 15 % in a 12-month period, improve glycaemic control, improve blood pressure and cardiovascular risk factors and significantly decrease the severity of obstructive sleep apnoea. As part of an integrated, multi-disciplinary approach, GLP-1 RA treatment in the medium to long term may be useful in those adolescents with severe obesity and OSA who are unable, unwilling or unsuitable for treatment with adenotonsillectomy or continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP]. Treatment benefits using GLP-1 RAs as adjunct therapy for OSA have been demonstrated in adults.

Triglycerides (TGs) have long been recognised as a risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Genetics, epidemiological studies and clinical trials have demonstrated a causal relationship between plasma triglycerides and ASCVD. In the bloodstream, TGs are mainly transported by lipoproteins such as VLDL and their remnants, the so-called TG-rich lipoproteins (TRL). A better understanding of the pathological consequences of elevated plasma TG levels is essential, especially in the context of addressing residual cardiovascular risk, when other major risk factors, in particular low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), are optimally controlled.",Cardiovascular Risk
40887304,"Gout, Uric Acid, and Coronary Artery Disease.","Hyperuricemia, the biochemical precursor to gout, is usually defined as the theoretical limit of solubility of serum uric acid (UA) of ＞7.0 mg/dL. Hyperuricemia is closely associated with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia, which are well known to be related to risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD). Furthermore, hyperuricemia has been associated with increased mortality in both the general population and individuals with cardiovascular diseases. Elevated UA in patients with CAD is accompanied by surrogate markers of atherosclerosis, including C-reactive protein, platelet activation, and endothelial dysfunction, which can contribute to possible pathogenic links between hyperuricemia and subsequent adverse cardiovascular events. Similarly, patients with gout have higher rates of cardiovascular diseases than those without it, independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Gout is a disease with variable levels of inflammation, driven by deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals. Recent imaging technology has revealed that deposition of MSU crystals can occur in the coronary arteries as well as the joints. However, current evidence does not support the efficacy of urate-lowering therapy on reducing cardiovascular events in patients with hyperuricemia; therefore, identifying individuals who may benefit from a sustained decrease in UA is crucial. We herein review the current understanding and future perspectives for management of hyperuricemia as a residual risk in patients with CAD.",Cardiovascular Risk

40886963,Adipose tissue macrophage-derived PPBP exacerbates psoriasis-associated atherosclerosis by inducing mitochondrial dysfunction in aortic endothelial cells.,"Chronic inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis are increasingly recognized as systemic diseases associated with an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this comorbidity remain poorly defined. In this study, transcriptomic analysis of dermal adipose tissue from psoriasis patients identified pro-platelet basic protein (PPBP) as a significantly upregulated chemokine, with elevated expression observed both locally within adipose macrophages and systemically in the circulation. Functionally, Ppbp-/- mice exhibited markedly attenuated psoriasiform skin inflammation, whereas administration of recombinant PPBP or topical imiquimod (IMQ) exacerbated atherosclerotic plaque formation in ApoE-/- mice. Importantly, Ppbp-/-ApoE-/- mice developed significantly smaller atheromatous plaques compared to ApoE-/- controls. Mechanistically, PPBP suppressed the expression of the zinc homeostasis regulator ZNG1F, leading to disrupted intracellular zinc balance, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress in human coronary artery endothelial cells. Therapeutically, PPBP neutralization or treatment with the mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant Mito-TEMPO significantly mitigated IMQ-exacerbated atherosclerosis in ApoE-/- mice. To our knowledge, we identify a previously unrecognized PPBP-ZNG1F-mitochondria axis as a potentially critical immune-metabolic link between psoriasis and CVD, highlighting PPBP as a promising biomarker and therapeutic target for reducing cardiovascular risk in chronic inflammatory skin disease.",Cardiovascular Risk

40886230,Can Dual Incretin Receptor Agonists Exert Better Cardiovascular Protection than Selective GLP-1 Receptor Agonists? Highlights from SURPASS-CVOT.,"Despite advances in cardiovascular risk reduction in type 2 diabetes (T2D), a persistent gap remains compared to individuals without diabetes. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) have provided consistent cardiovascular benefits. With more cardiovascular protective agents available for diabetes management, their incremental effect may be nearing a ceiling. The SURPASS-CVOT trial innovatively compared the dual GIP/GLP-1RA tirzepatide with the selective GLP-1RA dulaglutide, demonstrating noninferiority for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; HR 0.92; 95.3% CI 0.83-1.01; p = 0.086) and suggesting a potential 28% MACE risk reduction versus an imputed placebo. However, superiority over dulaglutide was narrowly missed. Despite greater improvements in glycemia (0.8% greater HbA1c reduction) and weight (7% greater weight loss), tirzepatide appeared to confer limited incremental cardiovascular benefit, raising questions about mechanism saturation or trial design constraints. Exploratory analyses showed promising benefits on mortality and renal function but require cautious interpretation. The trial's active comparator/imputed placebo design reflects an evolving ethical and therapeutic landscape in diabetes care. Whether dual incretin receptor agonism can meaningfully exceed current cardioprotective thresholds remains uncertain. By now, we may need new paradigms to overcome what may turn out to be a therapeutic ceiling for cardiovascular protection in the T2D population.",Cardiovascular Risk

40885139,Common Brazilian dietary pattern is associated with lower cardiovascular risk in adolescents.,"Studies on dietary patterns in adolescents can contribute to monitoring and prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Our hypothesis is that, in Brazilian adolescents, the coffee with bread and Common Brazilian dietary patterns are associated with a better cardiovascular profile, since they have previously been associated with a lower chance of being overweight. This study aims to verify the association between dietary patterns and cardiovascular risk (CVR) in adolescents using isolated and combined lipid variables in the form of indices. This is a cross-sectional study conducted with 825 adolescents from public schools. The dependent variables included alterations in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), triglycerides, and non-HDL-c, as well as the Castelli I and II indices and the triglycerides/HDL-c ratio. Three dietary patterns were identified through principal component analysis: Coffee with bread, Common Brazilian, and Mixed. Regression models were used to assess the association of these patterns with isolated lipid alterations and indices. Greater adherence to the Common Brazilian pattern reduced the odds of having elevated total cholesterol by 49% (OR: 0.51; 95% confidence intervals [95% CI]: 0.28, 0.94), elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 70% (OR: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.12, 0.72), elevated non-HDL-c by 42% (OR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.98), even after adjustment for potential confounders.

This article discusses a hybrid machine learning approach for cardiovascular risk prediction (HMLCRP) to address this problem. This approach combines logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVMs) and neural networks (NNs) to make predictions more correct and reliable. The proposed model looks at important coronary heart sickness risk factors, including excessive blood pressure, a record of coronary heart disorder within the family, pressure, age, sex, levels of cholesterol, body mass index (BMI) and poor dwelling choices. The hybrid technique makes use of the nice functions of LR for clean understanding, SVM for dealing with large amounts of facts and NNs for finding developments. By integrating these models together, the HMLCRP makes positive that type is correct and that danger predictions are accurate. In this study, benchmark datasets used, which include the cardio statistics set, heart ailment dataset and Framingham heart examination dataset, are used to train and test the version. Popular parameter measures, such as accuracy, precision, recall and the F1-score, are used to determine overall performance. The results of the experiments indicate that the HMLCRP is better at predicting effects than individual models.

Recently, two classes of medications-sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs)-have shown promise in protecting both kidney and heart health beyond their effects on blood sugar control. Methods: We conducted a narrative review summarizing the findings of different clinical trials and mechanistic studies evaluating the effect of SGLT2i and GLP-1 RAs on kidney function, cardiovascular outcomes, and overall disease progression in patients with CKD and DKD. Results: SGLT2i significantly mitigate kidney injury by restoring tubuloglomerular feedback, reducing intraglomerular hypertension, and attenuating inflammation, fibrosis, and oxidative stress. GLP-1 RAs complement these effects by enhancing endothelial function, promoting weight and blood pressure control, and exerting direct anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic actions on renal tissues. Landmark trials-CREDENCE, DAPA-CKD, and EMPA-KIDNEY-demonstrate that SGLT2i reduce the risk of kidney failure and renal or cardiovascular death by 25-40% in both diabetic and non-diabetic CKD populations. Likewise, trials such as LEADER, SUSTAIN, and AWARD-7 confirm that GLP-1 RAs slow renal function decline and improve cardiovascular outcomes. Early evidence suggests that using both drugs together may offer even greater benefits through multiple mechanisms. Conclusions: SGLT2i and GLP-1 RAs have redefined the therapeutic landscape of CKD by offering organ-protective benefits that extend beyond glycemic control. Whether used individually or in combination, these agents represent a paradigm shift toward integrated cardiorenal-metabolic care. A deeper understanding of their mechanisms and clinical utility in both diabetic and non-diabetic populations can inform evidence-based strategies to slow disease progression, reduce cardiovascular risk, and improve long-term patient outcomes in CKD.",Cardiovascular Risk
40871713,Comparison with Dietary Groups of Various Macronutrient Ratios on Body Weight and Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Adults: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis.,"Background: This network meta-analysis aimed to assess the relative efficacy of macronutrient dietary groups with varying carbohydrate, fat, and protein ratios on weight control and cardiovascular risk factors improvement in adults. Methods: We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Embase, Web of Science Core Collection, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to 30 November 2024, as well as reference lists of related systematic reviews. Eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. Literature screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were conducted independently by two reviewers. The changes in body weight, blood glucose, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, and total cholesterol were the study outcomes. Utilizing a Bayesian framework, a series of random-effects network meta-analyses were conducted to estimate mean difference (MD) with 95% credible interval (CrI) and determine the relative effectiveness of the macronutrient dietary groups. The quality of evidence for each pair of dietary groups was assessed based on the online tool called confidence in network meta-analysis (CINeMA). Results: This study initially identified 14,988 studies and ultimately included 66 eligible RCTs involving 4301 participants in the analysis. The very low carbohydrate-low protein (VLCLP, MD -4.10 kg, 95% CrI -6.70 to -1.54), the moderate carbohydrate-high protein (MCHP, MD -1.51 kg, 95% CrI -2.90 to -0.20), the very low carbohydrate-high protein (VLCHP, MD -1.35 kg, 95% CrI -2.52 to -0.26) dietary groups might lead to weight loss compared with the moderate fat-low protein (MFLP) dietary group. Among the dietary groups relative to the MFLP dietary group, the moderate carbohydrate-low protein (MCLP, MD 0.09 mmol/L, 95% CrI 0.02 to 0.16) and VLCHP (MD 0.16 mmol/L, 95% CrI 0.08 to 0.24) dietary groups were less effective in lowering HDL cholesterol, and the VLCHP (MD 0.50 mmol/L, 95% CrI 0.26 to 0.75) dietary group was less effective in lowering LDL cholesterol. In terms of triglyceride reduction, the MCLP (MD -0.33 mmol/L, 95% CrI -0.44 to -0.22), VLCHP (MD -0.31 mmol/L, 95% CrI -0.42 to -0.18), VLCLP (MD -0.14 mmol/L, 95% CrI -0.25 to -0.02), and moderate fat-high protein (MFHP, MD -0.13 mmol/L, 95% CrI -0.21 to -0.06) dietary groups were more efficacious than the MFLP dietary group, while any pair of dietary group interventions showed minimal to no difference in the effects on blood glucose, blood pressure, and total cholesterol. Conclusions: High or moderate certainty evidence reveals that the VLCLP dietary group is the most appropriate for weight loss, while the MCLP dietary group is best for reducing triglycerides. For control of blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels, there is little to no difference between macronutrient dietary groups. Additionally, future studies in normal-weight populations are needed to verify the applicability of our findings.",Cardiovascular Risk
40871660,Impact of Dietary Patterns on the Lipidemic Profile and the Cardiovascular Risk in Stage 1 Hypertension: A Post Hoc Analysis of the HINTreat Trial.,"Background/Objectives: In hypertension (HTN), lifestyle modification is important for controlling blood pressure (BP) and lipidemic profile. The HINTreat trial showed that an anti-inflammatory diet was associated with improved endothelial function, after six months of intensive nutritional treatment. Methods: This post hoc analysis of the HINTreat trial examined how adherence to various nutritional patterns like the Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet), the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, and anti-inflammatory diet, had impact on the blood lipids profile and the CVD risk. Patients with stage 1 HTN, allocated either on intensive lifestyle treatment (ILT) or usual care (UC) standard treatment, participated in the analysis. From the original sample size of the HINTreat trial, all patients that were prescribed lipid lowering medication at any time of the study period were excluded from the total analysis; thus, the intervention and the control groups consisted of 33 and 28 patients, respectively. Nutritional intakes were assessed with repeated 24 h recalls from the previous day, and dietary indexes and scores were calculated as follows: MedDiet score, DASH index, and Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII). After six months of intervention, changes in the nutritional indexes and their effect on the lipidemic profile and CVD risk were analyzed. Results: In the ILT group, reductions were noted in Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) for day systolic BP (SBP) (-12.7 mmHg) and diastolic BP (DBP) (-8.4 mmHg), total cholesterol (TC) (-35.4 mg/dL), triglycerides (TG) (-21.4 mg/dL), LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) (-27.5 mg/dL) concentrations, and CVD risk score (-1.5%), p < 0.001 for all. Multiple regression analysis showed that dietary quality indices independently influenced improvements in blood lipid profile and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk among patients receiving ILT. Specifically, a higher Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) score was significantly associated with reductions in TC (B = -7.238, p < 0.001), TG (B = -4.103, p = 0.035), and LDL-C (B = -6.431, p = 0.004). The DASH index was positively associated with TG levels (B = 9.913, p = 0.010), suggesting a more complex relationship that may require further investigation. In addition, DII was positively associated with increased CVD risk (B = 0.973, p < 0.001). Conclusions: The findings suggest that ILT can improve BP levels, target blood lipids concentrations, and reduce CVD risk in patients with stage 1 HTN.",Cardiovascular Risk
40871049,"Reprogramming Atherosclerosis: Precision Drug Delivery, Nanomedicine, and Immune-Targeted Therapies for Cardiovascular Risk Reduction.","Atherosclerosis is a progressive, multifactorial disease driven by the interplay of lipid dysregulation, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and maladaptive vascular remodeling. Despite advances in systemic lipid-lowering and anti-inflammatory therapies, residual cardiovascular risk persists, highlighting the need for more precise interventions. Targeted drug delivery represents a transformative strategy, offering the potential to modulate key pathogenic processes within atherosclerotic plaques while minimizing systemic exposure and off-target effects. Recent innovations span a diverse array of platforms, including nanoparticles, liposomes, exosomes, polymeric carriers, and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), engineered to engage distinct pathological features such as inflamed endothelium, dysfunctional macrophages, oxidative microenvironments, and aberrant lipid metabolism. Ligand-based, biomimetic, and stimuli-responsive delivery systems further enhance spatial and temporal precision. In parallel, advances in in-silico modeling and imaging-guided approaches are accelerating the rational design of multifunctional nanotherapeutics with theranostic capabilities. Beyond targeting lipids and inflammation, emerging strategies seek to modulate immune checkpoints, restore endothelial homeostasis, and reprogram plaque-resident macrophages. This review provides an integrated overview of the mechanistic underpinnings of atherogenesis and highlights state-of-the-art targeted delivery systems under preclinical and clinical investigation. By synthesizing recent advances, we aim to elucidate how precision-guided drug delivery is reshaping the therapeutic landscape of atherosclerosis and to chart future directions toward clinical translation and personalized vascular medicine.",Cardiovascular Risk
40870929,Validation of a Manual Method for Measuring Left Atrial Reservoir Strain Against Automated Speckle Tracking Analysis.,"Background: Left atrial strain, particularly reservoir strain, has emerged as a sensitive marker of left atrial function and an early indicator of diastolic dysfunction and cardiovascular risk. However, automated left atrial strain analysis is not universally available, particularly in resource-limited settings. In this study, we propose a manual method for calculating biplane left atrial reservoir strain and validate its agreement with automated software in patients with atrial fibrillation and in sinus rhythm. Methods: Echocardiography examinations from 30 patients with atrial fibrillation and 30 patients in sinus rhythm were analyzed. Left atrial reservoir strain was calculated using both an automatic speckle tracking imaging-based algorithm and a manual point-by-point method based on atrial wall delineation. Agreement between methods was assessed using Pearson correlation, Bland-Altman analysis, and intraclass correlation coefficient. Results: Strong correlation and excellent agreement were observed between the two methods in both groups. Pearson correlation coefficients were r = 0.95 (p < 0.0001) in the atrial fibrillation group and r = 0.94 (p < 0.0001) in the sinus rhythm group. Bland-Altman analysis showed narrow limits of agreement, particularly in the atrial fibrillation group. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.95 in atrial fibrillation and 0.92 in sinus rhythm, indicating excellent reliability. The standard error of measurement and minimal detectable change were low in both groups. Conclusions: Manual measurement of left atrial reservoir strain is feasible, reproducible, and demonstrates excellent agreement with automated software. It may serve as a reliable alternative in clinical scenarios where automated tools are unavailable.",Cardiovascular Risk
40870914,Predictive Modeling of Acute Hypertensive Disorders in a Real-World Cohort: Integrating Clinical Predictors and Data-Driven Methods.,"Background: Acute hypertensive disorders, including hypertensive emergencies (HEs) and urgencies (HUs), are a frequent cause of emergency department (ED) visits. Early differentiation between HEs and HUs is essential, as their clinical management and prognostic implications differ substantially. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed patients admitted to an Italian second-level ED between January and June 2022 with systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 180 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure(DBP) ≥ 110 mmHg. Patients were categorized based on the presence of acute hypertension-mediated organ damage (A-HMOD). To identify the main predictors of HEs, we applied both conventional logistic regression and machine learning approaches (Elastic Net and Random Forest). Results: Among 23,678 ED admissions, 261 patients (1.1%) had acute hypertensive disorders, of whom 115 (44%) were diagnosed with HEs and 146 (56%) with HUs. Compared with HU patients, HE patients were older and showed higher SBPand DBP at presentation, along with a greater prevalence of comorbidities such as diabetes, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease (all p < 0.05). In multivariable logistic regression, troponin I levels independently predicted the occurrence of HEs (OR: 2.82; 95%CI: 1.65-4.82; p < 0.001), even after adjusting for confounders. Machine learning analyses confirmed troponin I as the most influential predictor, followed by age and SBP, with the Random Forest model achieving a high predictive performance (AUCROC: 0.93; 95%CI: 0.90-0.96). Elastic Net regression further highlighted troponin I as the most influential variable with the highest standardized coefficient (β = 4.13). As determined by the Youden index, the optimal diagnostic threshold for troponin I was 0.12 ng/mL (AUCROC: 0.66; 95%CI: 0.60-0.72). Conclusions: In patients presenting to the ED, withacute hypertensive disorders, elevated troponin I levels, older age, and higher SBP at admission may serve as early indicators of emergencies.",Cardiovascular Risk

In this study, HBb-Bps were conjugated with honey via a Maillard reaction and their physicochemical properties, digestive stability, antioxidant capacity, and anti-obesogenic effects were evaluated. Simulated gastrointestinal digestion revealed significantly enhanced resistance after conjugation, with the residual content increasing from 46.99% for native HBb-Bps to 86.12% for the honey-conjugated forms; furthermore, antioxidant activity was largely preserved according to the DPPH and ABTS assays. In the in vivo experiments, 30 male BrlHan: WIST@Jcl (GALAS) (Wistar) rats were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) to induce obesity and orally administered honey-conjugated HBb-Bps at doses of 200, 500, or 1000 mg/kg body weight for 16 weeks. The highest dose led to significant reductions in body weight gain, the Lee index, and body mass index. The serum lipid profiles markedly improved, with decreases in the total cholesterol, triglyceride, and LDL levels, as well as cardiovascular risk indices. Furthermore, fecal analysis showed increased levels of short-chain fatty acids, particularly butyrate. These changes suggest enhanced gut microbial activity; however, the prebiotic effects were inferred from the SCFA profiles, as the gut microbiota composition was not directly analyzed. In conclusion, honey-conjugated HBb-Bps improve gastrointestinal stability and exhibit antioxidant, hypolipidemic, and gut-modulating effects, supporting their potential use as functional ingredients for managing diet-induced metabolic disorders.",Cardiovascular Risk
40870513,Cardiovascular Risk in People Living with HIV: A Preliminary Case Study from Romania.,"Background and Objectives: AIDS-related mortality has significantly decreased due to antiretroviral therapy (ART), leading to a substantial increase in average lifespan. Consequently, cardiovascular diseases have become a growing concern among people living with HIV (PLWH). This study aimed to assess the cardiovascular risk profile of people living with HIV receiving ART and to explore the association between traditional and HIV-related factors with increased cardiovascular risk. Materials and Methods: We conducted a case study involving 112 PLWH receiving ART at a specialized clinic in southeastern Romania to estimate cardiovascular risk (CVR) using the Data Collection on Adverse Events of Anti-HIV Drugs (D:A:D®) score. For participants aged 40 and above, the SCORE2 algorithm was additionally applied. Results: Most participants were male and under 40 years of age, including 34 individuals from Romania's distinct pediatric HIV cohort. We observed a substantial cardiovascular risk burden: abdominal obesity was present in 24.1% of participants, active smoking was reported by 55.4%, and over 70% had low physical activity levels. Among participants aged 40 and above, the D:A:D® and SCORE2 scores were strongly correlated, with an average cardiovascular age exceeding chronological age by a mean of 7.5 years. Although CVR remained similarly low among subgroups of PLWH under 40, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome was higher in patients from the pediatric cohort compared to those diagnosed later. Traditional risk factors-such as age, obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, and alcohol use-as well as elevated C-reactive protein levels, were significantly associated with increased CVR. Conclusions: Residual inflammation in PLWH, despite complete viral suppression in combination with metabolic syndrome, is associated with increased cardiovascular risk even in younger and clinically stable populations. Routine integration of metabolic and cardiovascular risk screening into HIV care may support timely prevention and personalized management strategies starting at an early age.",Cardiovascular Risk
40870484,"Epidemiology and Management of Ankle Fractures Prior to, During, and Following the COVID-19 Pandemic in an Italian Tertiary Hospital.","Background and Objectives: Ankle fractures represent one of the most common injuries to the lower limb, particularly impacting women and the elderly. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic greatly disrupted both the incidence of these fractures and their treatment patterns globally. This retrospective epidemiological study analyzed 1010 cases of ankle fractures treated at the Orthopedics Department of Policlinico University Hospital in Catania from 2018 to 2023. The study aimed to evaluate trends in incidence, patient demographics, fracture types, treatment modalities, and hospital stay across the pre-COVID-19, COVID-19, and post-COVID-19 periods. Materials and Methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted including all patients diagnosed with ankle fractures from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2023. Data were collected from hospital medical records using ICD-9-CM codes and radiographic classification systems (Danis-Weber, Lauge-Hansen, and AO/OTA). Variables analyzed included demographics, fracture type and side, treatment modality, and hospitalization details. Statistical analyses were performed using t-tests, chi-square tests, and linear regression, with significance set at p < 0.05. Results: In 2020, there was a 31.7% decrease in fracture incidence. Although overall fracture rates rebounded after COVID-19, they did not reach pre-pandemic levels. During the pandemic, trimalleolar fractures increased significantly, occurring more frequently in older women, likely due to bone fragility. The rate of surgical treatments rose during and after the pandemic, with a distinct shift from ORIF to external fixation. Hospital stays were longer, especially for patients with cardiovascular risk factors. Conclusions: The pandemic significantly altered the epidemiology, treatment strategies, and outcomes of ankle fractures. These findings highlight the necessity for adaptable care models and preventive strategies, particularly for vulnerable populations such as older women.",Cardiovascular Risk
40870478,Systemic Immune-Inflammation Index and Related Hematologic Markers as Prognostic Tools in Type 2 Diabetes.,"Background and Objectives: Chronic low-grade inflammation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its vascular complications. Hematological indices derived from routine blood counts, such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), derived neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (dNLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), systemic inflammation response index (SIRI), and aggregate index of systemic inflammation (AISI), have been proposed as surrogate markers for systemic inflammation and predictors of cardiovascular risk. This study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of these inflammatory indices concerning the presence of micro- and macrovascular complications and cardiovascular mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study including 237 patients with T2DM. We assessed the association between hematological indices and cardiovascular mortality, followed by a ROC curve analysis to evaluate their predictive performance, and a multiple logistic regression. Results: Thirty patients (12.66%) died during the study period. ROC analysis showed that SIRI (AUC = 0.680 [95% CI 0.576-0.779]), LMR (AUC = 0.667 [95% CI 0.564-0.763]), AISI (AUC = 0.662 [95% CI 0.553-0.768]), and NLR (AUC = 0.657 [95% CI 0.545-0.764]) had the best discriminative capacity, all with specificity >70%. The relation remained significant even after adjustments for confounding variables in multiple logistic regression. For microvascular complications, Monocyte count (AUC = 0.611 [95% CI 0.532-0.69]) and LMR (AUC = 0.608 [95% CI 0.521-0.695]) showed minimal but notable predictive value. Conclusions: SIRI, LMR, AISI, and NLR were significantly associated with mortality and demonstrated modest discriminative ability. These markers, accessible and cost-effective, may be useful tools for risk stratification in T2DM patients. Further validation in prospective cohorts is warranted.",Cardiovascular Risk
40870394,Arterial Stiffness and Early Cardiac Dysfunction in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Potential Role for 25 OH Vitamin D3 Deficiency.,"Background and Objectives: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with subclinical cardiovascular changes, such as increased arterial stiffness and myocardial dysfunction. Vitamin D deficiency has been recognized as a potential contributing factor to vascular disease; however, its impact on early cardiac changes associated with T2DM remains poorly understood. Our aim was to evaluate the association between serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3], arterial stiffness, and left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LV GLS) in patients with T2DM who do not have a clinically evident cardiovascular disease. Material and methods: This cross-sectional study evaluated the carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), aortic pulse wave velocity (PWVao), LV GLS, and serum 25(OH)D3 levels in patients diagnosed with T2DM (n = 65) compared to healthy control subjects (n = 55). Independent predictors of arterial stiffness were identified by a multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: Patients with T2DM showed a significant increase in IMT and PWVao, a reduction in LV GLS, and low levels of 25(OH)D3 compared to subjects in the control group (all p < 0.05). Both vitamin D deficiency and T2DM were found to be independently associated with an increased arterial stiffness, with odds ratios of 2.4 and 4.8, respectively. A significant inverse relationship was identified between 25(OH)D3 levels and markers of arterial stiffness, as well as LV GLS, suggesting a possible association between the vitamin D status and the early onset of cardiovascular dysfunction. Conclusions: Patients with T2DM show early signs of heart and blood vessel problems, even with an ejection fraction that remains within normal limits. There is a significant correlation between vitamin D deficiency and increased arterial stiffness, along with impaired LV GLS, indicating its possible involvement in cardiovascular complications associated with diabetes. These findings support the utility of integrating vascular, myocardial, and vitamin D assessments in early cardiovascular risk stratification for T2DM patients.",Cardiovascular Risk
40870369,"Predicting Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events After Cardiac Surgery Using Combined Clinical, Laboratory, and Echocardiographic Parameters: A Machine Learning Approach.","Background and Objectives: Despite significant advances in surgical techniques and perioperative care, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) remain a leading cause of postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting and/or aortic valve replacement. Accurate preoperative risk stratification is essential yet often limited by models that overlook atrial mechanics and underutilized biomarkers. Materials and Methods: This study aimed to develop an interpretable machine learning model for predicting perioperative MACE by integrating clinical, biochemical, and echocardiographic features, with a particular focus on novel physiological markers. A retrospective cohort of 131 patients was analyzed. An Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classifier was trained on a comprehensive feature set, and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAPs) were used to quantify each variable's contribution to model predictions. Results: In a stratified 80:20 train-test split, the model initially achieved an AUC of 1.00. Acknowledging the potential for overfitting in small datasets, additional validation was performed using 10 independent random splits and 5-fold cross-validation. These analyses yielded an average AUC of 0.846 ± 0.092 and an F1-score of 0.807 ± 0.096, supporting the model's stability and generalizability. The most influential predictors included total atrial conduction time, mitral and tricuspid annular orifice areas, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. These variables, spanning electrophysiological, structural, and metabolic domains, significantly enhanced discriminative performance, even in patients with preserved left ventricular function. The model's transparency provides clinically intuitive insights into individual risk profiles, emphasizing the significance of non-traditional parameters in perioperative assessments. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the feasibility and potential clinical value of combining advanced echocardiographic, biochemical, and machine learning tools for individualized cardiovascular risk prediction. While promising, these findings require prospective validation in larger, multicenter cohorts before being integrated into routine clinical decision-making.",Cardiovascular Risk

Healthcare system- and patient-related barriers hinder the successful management of hypertension. This study aimed to identify the perceptions of barriers and facilitators to hypertension management among health system stakeholders in Santander, Colombia. Materials and Methods: We conducted a qualitative, phenomenological, and interpretative study, comprising five focus groups, to explore the barriers and facilitators to managing people with hypertension. Each focus group was formed by stakeholders from territorial entities, healthcare insurers, or healthcare providers. Meetings were held between December 2022 and February 2023. The sessions were recorded and transcribed using NVivo Transcription and analyzed using NVivo version 1.6.1. Results: Seven categories of barriers and facilitators were identified: strategies, resources, access, risk assessment, cross-sector collaboration, articulation, and stewardship. Of these categories, articulation and stewardship emerged as the main barriers, as revealed through axial coding and cluster analysis, which highlighted deficiencies in stewardship practices, a lack of clear objectives, and misalignment with public policy frameworks. Conclusions: Multisectoral actions extending beyond healthcare providers and aimed at improving coordination and intersectoral collaboration are essential for enhancing hypertension control in LMICs, such as Colombia.

40869604,Sex Differences in Cardiovascular Risk and Diabetic Polyneuropathy: A Single-Center Retrospective Study in North-Eastern Hungary.,"Background/Objectives: Diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy (DSPN) is a frequent microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus, associated with increased morbidity and reduced quality of life. The existing literature offers a limited understanding of sex-specific cardiovascular risk profiles and their association with DSPN, particularly within Central and Eastern European populations. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted using data from 621 individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus who underwent comprehensive neuropathy screening at the University of Debrecen between 2017 and 2021. The diagnosis of DSPN was made in accordance with international criteria, incorporating symptom scores, and electrophysiological measurements. Multivariate logistic regression was applied in order to identify independent predictors. Results: The diagnosis of DSPN was made in 444 individuals (71.5%), of whom 58.2% were female. Despite similar glycemic control (HbA1c: 7.81% in men vs. 7.65% in women, p = 0.297), men had significantly more frequent occurrences of previous myocardial infarction (11.8% vs. 5.0%, p = 0.008), peripheral vascular disease (19.9% vs. 12.7%, p = 0.041) and atherosclerosis (31.7% vs. 22.0%, p = 0.021). Multivariate analysis showed that female gender was independently associated with a lower incidence of DSPN (odds ratio [OR] = 0.592, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.369-0.950, p = 0.030), while diabetic retinopathy was a significant predictor (OR = 2.728, 95% CI: 1.300-5.725, p = 0.008). Electrophysiological testing revealed lower nerve conduction amplitudes in females for selected nerves. Conclusions: Our findings highlight sex-specific differences in neuropathy risk and support the implementation of individualized screening strategies in diabetic populations with region-specific risk factors.",Cardiovascular Risk
40869583,Prevalence of Cardiovascular Risk Factors Among Adults in the European Union: A Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis.,"Background: Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in Europe. The cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) with the greatest clinical impact are high blood pressure (HBP), type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), smoking, overweight, obesity, dyslipidaemia, and sedentary lifestyle. The objective of this review was to compare the prevalence of the different CVRFs according to population-based studies conducted in the European Union. Methods: This systematic review aimed to assess the prevalence of CVRFs in the European Union. A comprehensive search strategy was employed, including databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, using specific keywords related to cardiovascular risk factors, prevalence, and European countries. The quality of the reviewed studies was assessed using established criteria, categorising them as low, moderate, or high quality. Results: A total of 26 studies from Belgium, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, and Sweden were included. The findings revealed considerable variability in the prevalence of CVRFs across the European Union, with overweight, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension being the most frequently reported. Prevalence rates varied notably by country, age group, and sample characteristics. The majority of the included studies were of moderate methodological quality, underscoring the need for more rigorous research to better support evidence-based policies and targeted health interventions. Conclusions: There are differences between the studies presented, ranging from the sex ratio, the age studied, to even the CVRFs included.

Methods: In 56 treatment-naive pediatric patients with PH (15.1 ± 2.1 years) and 30 healthy children (14.9 ± 1.4 years), we evaluated BPV: BP dipping, standard deviation (SD) of ambulatory blood pressure measurements (ABPMs), pulse pressure (PP)/systolic blood pressure ratio (24 h PP/SBP), rate-pressure index (24 h RPI), 24-h weighted BPV (24 h WSBPV, 24 h WDBV, 24 h WMAPV), coefficient of variation (24 h CoVSBP, 24 h CoVDBP, 24 h CoVMAP), ambulatory arterial stiffness index (AASI), and morning BP surge. We also analyzed indices of subclinical inflammation (markers derived from complete blood count, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 18), and office and ambulatory BP. Results: Patients with PH had significantly higher hsCRP, neutrophils, monocytes, and platelets, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte (NLR), platelet-to-mean platelet volume (PMPVR), and lower monocyte-to-neutrophil (MNR) ratios, and higher BPV: 24 h ABPM SBP SD, 24 h ABPM MAP SD, 24 h RPI, 24 h WSBPV, 24 h WDBV, 24 h WMAPV, and 24 h CoVSBP. Low-grade inflammation markers correlated with BPV indices in both groups. In multivariate analysis, MNR predicted 24 h ABPM MAP SD (beta = 0.290, 95CI: 0.029-0.551), 24 h RPI (beta = -0.348, 95CI: -0.587--0.108), and 24 h WDBPV (beta = 0.286, 95CI: 0.032-0.540); monocyte count-24 h RPI (beta = 0.281, 95CI: 0.041-0.521), and hsCRP-24 h WDBV (beta = 0.310, 95CI: 0.055-0.564). ROC analysis revealed a good diagnostic profile for lymphocyte count as a positive determinant of non-dipping status in PH children (cut-off point 2.59 [×103/µL]). Conclusions: BPV is higher in children with PH compared to healthy peers and is associated with low-grade inflammation. MNR may be the most helpful indicator of BPV, whereas high lymphocyte count predicts the best non-dipping status in these patients.",Cardiovascular Risk
40869557,Factors Related to Decline of Renal Function in Patients with Chronic Hypoparathyroidism.,"Background/Objectives: Patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism are at increased risk of kidney complications. Also, chronic kidney disease is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. The aim was to analyze the factors that influence kidney function, including cardiovascular diseases (CVD), in a cohort of patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism. Methods: This was a retrospective longitudinal study that included 100 patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism. Results: The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was associated with the duration of disease (p = 0.014). During follow-up, a significant decrease in eGFR was observed over time (p < 0.001), and changes in the eGFR were associated with the duration of disease (p < 0.001). We found that the eGFR was lower in patients with urolithiasis (p = 0.003), hypertension (p < 0.001), type 2 diabetes (p = 0.031) and dyslipidemia (p < 0.001). In total, 14% of patients had a chronic kidney disease (CKD), and these patients had a longer duration of disease (p < 0.001). The percentage of patients with urolithiasis (p = 0.003), nephrocalcinosis (p = 0.008), hypertension (p = 0.005), type 2 diabetes (p < 0.001), dyslipidemia (p < 0.001), coronary heart disease (p = 0.008), and arrhythmia (p < 0.001) was higher in patients with CKD. Logistic regression models showed that disease duration was associated with CKD (OR = 1.11; 95% CI [1.03-1.22]; p = 0.008). We used ROC curves to assess the usefulness of disease duration as a marker of CKD, and the AUC was 0.850 (95% CI 0.763-0.937, p < 0.001). A duration of disease > 15.5 years had a sensitivity of 85.7% and a specificity of 71.9% for a diagnosis of CKD. Conclusions: The duration of disease appears to be a predictor of the presence of renal dysfunction in patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism. In addition, the coexistence of CVD factors could result in greater renal damage.",Cardiovascular Risk
40869535,"Long-Term Effectiveness of Acetylsalicylic Acid in Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Diseases and Mortality in Patients at High Risk, a Retrospective Cohort Study-The JOANA Study.","Background/Objectives: Although differences seem to exist by age in primary cardiovascular prevention with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), direct comparisons are lacking, as are studies with real-world data. We sought to examine the effectiveness of ASA in reducing cardiovascular diseases and overall mortality in patients at high risk by age subgroups. Methods: We designed a retrospective cohort study using the database of the Catalan primary care system (SIDIAP), Spain, for the period 2006-2020. Included participants were high-cardiovascular-risk individuals without previous vascular disease. We considered people aged 40 to 59 and ≥60 years of age. We assessed the incidences of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), all-cause mortality, and ASA adverse effects using Cox proportional hazards modelling, adjusted by the propensity score of ASA treatment. Results: During the study period, 7576 and 30,282 people were aged 40 to 59 and ≥60 years, respectively. The median follow-up was 11.21 (10.71-11.54) years (40 to 59 year-olds) and 11.09 (10.55-11.54) years (≥60 year-olds). The hazard ratio of ASA use for ASCVD in the group aged 40-59 years was 0.64 (0.41-0.99). The number needed to treat in this group was 40 persons and the number that needed to harm for gastrointestinal bleeding (the only adverse effect with significant hazard ratio) was 75 individuals. Conclusions: This direct comparison of real-world age groups at high cardiovascular risk showed no benefit but increased risk in the older population (≥60 years). In the younger subgroup, our observations would support primary prevention with ASA with a consideration of the individual optimal risk-benefit.",Cardiovascular Risk
40869505,"Tuberculosis in Pregnant Women After COVID-19: Features of Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment (Narrative Review).","Tuberculosis remains a serious infectious disease that causes over 1.3 million deaths annually. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, the global incidence of tuberculosis has increased to 10.8 million cases. Pregnant women represent a particularly vulnerable population requiring tailored approaches to the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of tuberculosis. SARS-CoV-2 infection may have impacted existing clinical protocols. Implementing updated methods of tuberculosis prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in pregnant women could help reduce adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. The aim of this review was to explore potential modifications in tuberculosis management among pregnant women in the post-COVID-19 era, including co-infection with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: A review was conducted, incorporating a systematic literature search across major international databases, including Medline, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar. The search covered publications released between December 2019 and September 2024 and used targeted keywords such as ""COVID-19"" OR ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""tuberculosis"" OR ""TB"" OR ""latent tuberculosis infection"" OR ""pulmonary tuberculosis"", and ""pregnancy"" OR ""pregnant women"". Results: Pregnant women living with HIV are at increased risk of developing tuberculosis, which can negatively affect both maternal and perinatal outcomes. Screening for tuberculosis is recommended for all HIV-positive pregnant women, even in the absence of clinical symptoms. Notably, immunological testing before and during pregnancy facilitates the timely and safe detection of tuberculosis infection, enabling preventive and therapeutic interventions during any stage of gestation and the early postpartum period, for the benefit of both mother and child. Drug-drug interactions play a significant role in tuberculosis management, both among anti-tuberculosis agents and with medications for comorbid conditions. Current knowledge of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antituberculosis agents, coupled with therapeutic drug monitoring, supports the development of individualized and effective treatment regimens, which are particularly critical for pregnant patients. Recommendations for managing tuberculosis in pregnant women after COVID-19 infection include measuring D-dimer levels, performing echocardiography, and consulting cardiologists to prevent treatment-related complications. Conclusions: Pregnant women represent a distinct subgroup of tuberculosis patients requiring individualized management. Changes observed in tuberculosis progression and treatment responses in pregnant women before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection should inform therapeutic choices, especially in cases of drug-resistant tuberculosis treated with bedaquiline. COVID-19 has been associated with increased cardiovascular risk, which may heighten the likelihood of adverse drug reactions in this population, especially given the limited therapeutic options. Further research is required to assess the long-term outcomes of latent tuberculosis infection in pregnant women and to evaluate the safety and efficacy of novel regimens for drug-resistant TB during pregnancy.",Cardiovascular Risk
40869467,"Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia and Troponin Elevation: Insights into Mechanisms, Risk Factors, and Outcomes.","Background: Elevated cardiac troponin (cTn) levels in patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) often prompt coronary artery disease evaluation, though the clinical relevance of this finding remains unclear. This study aimed to identify risk factors for cTn elevation after a PSVT episode and assess its clinical significance, including the role of coronary artery disease (CAD) and long-term outcomes. Methods: We retrospectively collected data on demographics, presenting symptoms, comorbidities, chronic antiarrhythmic medication use, tachycardia duration, admission systolic blood pressure (SBP), heart rate (HR), laboratory findings, and cardioversion method in patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with PSVT over a 4-year period. Patients were stratified into two groups based on the presence or absence of troponin elevation. Individuals with elevated cTn levels and at least one cardiovascular risk factor were further evaluated for CAD. One-year outcomes included SVT recurrence, rehospitalization, ablation, and mortality. Results: Among 120 patients with PSVT, 58 (48.3%) exhibited elevated cardiac troponin (cTn) levels. Independent predictors of cTn elevation included retrosternal chest pain, absence of prior SVT history, higher admission HR, and lower SBP. A heart rate cut-off of 165 bpm was identified as optimal for predicting cTn elevation (sensitivity 62.1%, specificity 72.6%). Of the 58 cTn (+) patients, 25 underwent CAD evaluation, with only 1 case (4%) confirming significant coronary disease. At one-year follow-up (n = 118), troponin elevation was not associated with increased SVT recurrence, rehospitalization, ablation, or mortality. Similarly, CAD evaluation in troponin-positive patients did not predict outcomes. Conclusions: Troponin elevation after PSVT is frequent but not prognostically significant. It is likely due to transient myocardial stress rather than CAD, supporting a conservative, individualized approach to further testing.",Cardiovascular Risk
40869463,Screening and Awareness for Blood Pressure in a Non-Medical Setting: The Vienna Hairdresser Initiative.,"Background: Arterial hypertension (HTN) is the leading modifiable cardiovascular risk factor for overall mortality worldwide. In Austria, 1.6 million individuals above the age of 15, representing 20% of the total population and 70% of adults aged 65 and older, suffer from HTN. Despite numerous antihypertensive treatment options on the European market, only 38.8% of patients on optimal medical treatment (OMT) reach their treatment goal. Primary prevention remains a challenge, particularly for HTN and the consequential risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Thus, there is an urgent need for Disease Management Programs (DMPs). We sought to study a possible trial to diagnose hypertension in a non-medical setting at a very early stage of the disease and raise awareness for hypertension in affected people to avoid future complications of unrecognized and untreated HTN. For a non-medical setting, hairdressers fulfil many criteria for an optimal blood pressure (BP) measurement. Methods: This is a pilot study. A total of 193 individuals were included at a Viennese hairdresser. Metric data were described either using mean ± SD given normal distribution or median otherwise. Categorical data were described using absolute frequencies and percentages. For comparison, either independent t-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests or chi2 tests were assessed. The staff received expert training on how to measure blood pressure in a guideline-compliant way. All members signed the written and informed consent and received a questionnaire about their demographic data and cardiovascular risk factors. Results: Of the 193 participants in this study, 56.5% (109/193) were female and 43.5% (84/193) were male. The mean age was 54 ± 15.1 years. In the automatically measured office blood pressure (AOBP) measurement, the mean systolic BP was 137.1 ± 17.8 and the mean diastolic BP was 91.6 ± 11.2. Of all participants, 65.8% (127/193) were hypertensive, whereof 74.8% (95/127) had no treatment at all. Among 127 individuals evaluated, 63% (80/127) were unaware of their elevated blood pressure levels, while 28% (44/127) had a prior diagnosis of HTN. The control rate of the individuals with previously diagnosed HTN was very low, with only 18.5% [10.4; 30.9] reaching normotensive values in the current measurement. There was no difference in BP values of patients with previously diagnosed HTN and patients who were unaware of their disease. Antihypertensive treatment was being received by 20.2% (39/193), while 62.2% had not taken their prescribed blood pressure medication on the day of recruitment. Conclusions: This is the first Austrian study to show that screening for HTN in an unconventional non-medical setting is effective to diagnose HTN and raise awareness. Based on the even-higher-than-expected prevalence of HTN, we plan to conduct a cohort study in Vienna, inviting all hairdressers in socially deprived districts to act as gate openers for hypertensive subjects to raise awareness and to contact a regional GP for provision of medical care. An implementation of such a cost-effective and feasible disease management program in Austria might therefore reduce the burden of preventable cardiovascular events associated with HTN.",Cardiovascular Risk
40869453,Characterization of the Left Ventricular Myocardium in Systemic Sclerosis.,"Background/Objectives: Cardiac involvement in systemic sclerosis (SSc) ranges from subclinical to severe. While pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) is well-documented, the mechanism of left ventricular (LV) ischemia remains unclear. Oxygen-sensitive cardiovascular magnetic resonance (OS-CMR) imaging offers a novel approach to assessing myocardial oxygenation and ischemia. This study evaluated the changes in myocardial deoxygenation in response to stress using LV OS-CMR in SSc patients without known cardiac disease. Methods: We prospectively recruited SSc patients without prior cardiac disease or risk factors, and age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers (HVs). All participants underwent transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and 3T CMR, including native T1 mapping, rest/stress OS-CMR, stress perfusion, and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). The primary outcome was a change in the LV OS-CMR signal intensity (SI) after adenosine stress. Results: Thirty-three participants (23 SSc, 10 HV) were enrolled. SSc patients had significantly lower global LV OS-CMR SI compared to HV (13.4 ± 6.5 vs. 19.5 ± 3.6, p = 0.011). OS-CMR SI change ≤ 10% was observed in at least one segment in 20 (87%) SSc patients and globally in 12 (52%). LGE was present in 5 (22%) patients, and 18 (78%) had ≥1 abnormal T1 mapping segment. LV global longitudinal strain (GLS) was reduced in SSc patients compared to the HVs (-19.04 ± 3.86 vs. -21.92 ± 3.72, p = 0.045). All HVs had normal CMR and TTE findings. Conclusions: SSc patients without known cardiovascular disease or PAH demonstrated subclinical LV ischemia with an impaired myocardial oxygenation response to stress. They further demonstrated LV myocardial deformation abnormalities and LV diffuse fibrosis when compared to an age-matched control group. Our findings support the presence of early coronary microvascular dysfunction and LV myocardial fibrosis in this population, which may explain the adverse cardiovascular risk seen in this population, independent of the presence of PAH.",Cardiovascular Risk
40869400,Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease: A Silent Driver of Cardiovascular Risk and a New Target for Intervention.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) significantly increases the risk of steatohepatitis and cirrhosis and multiple extrahepatic complications, in particular, cardiometabolic disease, including type 2 diabetes, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD), and heart failure, with a significant negative impact on health-related quality of life, becoming a substantial economic burden. Moreover, cardiovascular events represent the leading cause of death in MASLD patients. A timely diagnosis stratifies patient for their risk. It can facilitate early lifestyle changes or pharmacological management of dysmetabolic conditions, thereby slowing disease progression, lowering cardiovascular risk, and preventing CVD and cirrhosis. In this narrative review, we will discuss the current knowledge on MASLD and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) pathophysiology, emphasizing their systemic nature, the link to CVD, and available and emerging treatment strategies.",Cardiovascular Risk
40869310,"Altered β-Adrenergic System, Cardiac Dysfunction, and Lethal Arrhythmia in a Rat Model of Metabolic Syndrome.","Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a worldwide problem affecting at least one-third of the population. MetS patients have increased cardiovascular risk associated with an abnormal β-adrenergic response; however, it is not clear how MetS affects the cardiac β-adrenergic system. We analyzed cardiac function and the β-adrenergic response in an experimental model of MetS in rats by recording pressure-volume (PV) loops via an open-chest approach and performed a biochemical characterization of the cardiac β-adrenergic system through ELISA, radioligand binding assays, and Western blotting. Microscopy was employed to evaluate cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and ultrastructure. MetS rats exhibited cardiac dysfunction, evidenced by a reduced cardiac output and ejection fraction, not explained by heart hypertrophy or fibrosis. MetS rats also had an elevated susceptibility to lethal arrhythmia following intra-cardiac administration of the non-selective β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, suggesting alterations in the β-adrenergic system. The total serum adrenaline and noradrenaline levels were higher in the MetS animals than those in the control group. The radioligand binding assays indicated no change in the βAR density; however, the Western blot analyses revealed decreased levels of Gαs proteins and β-arrestin 1, but increased β2AR and Gαi protein levels. This study contributes to our understanding of how MetS can alter cardiac function, raising the risk of lethal arrhythmia induced by the β-adrenergic (fight or flight) response and underscores the relevance of therapeutically targeting MetS before its pathological progression toward cardiomyopathy.",Cardiovascular Risk
40869066,"Significant Interplay Between Lipids, Cytokines, Chemokines, Growth Factors, and Blood Cells in an Outpatient Cohort.","Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading global cause of morbidity and mortality, largely driven by atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammatory process involving lipids and immune cells. Although traditional lipid biomarkers such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) are well-established in CVD risk stratification, the interplay between cytokines, chemokines, growth factors (CCGFs), lipid metabolism, and hematological parameters in non-cardiac populations remains underexplored. We investigated associations between plasma cytokines and lipid-related biomarkers and their relationships with circulating blood cell counts in a cohort of 164 essentially healthy adults aged 18-44 years. CCGF profiling was performed using a proximity extension assay (PEA), and statistical correlations were adjusted for multiple testing using false discovery rate (FDR) correction. The CCGFs that were associated with HDL and apolipoprotein A1 all displayed negative associations. Several pro-inflammatory cytokines, including CCL3, IL-6, and TNFSF10, showed strong positive associations with triglycerides, remnants, non-HDL, and body mass index (BMI). Furthermore, triglycerides and remnants were consistently correlated with elevated leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts. HGF and FGF-21, mainly considered as anti-inflammatory, were positively associated with BMI and negatively associated with HDL, which is compliant with a multitude of actions, depending on the local milieu and the cellular interplay. Our results support the existence of a complex immunometabolic network involving lipids, CCGFs, and blood cells, even in non-diseased individuals. The observed patterns underscore the importance of understanding the intricate cytokine-lipid-cell interactions that may occur in early pathophysiological processes and highlight their potential utility in refining cardiovascular risk assessment beyond traditional lipid metrics.",Cardiovascular Risk
40868976,Evaluation of Total Homocysteine Levels in Relation to Abdominal Fat Mass and Traditional Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Overweight and Obese Adolescents.,"Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of mortality worldwide, with multiple risk factors contributing to their development. Among these, obesity and hyperhomocysteinemia have been recognized as significant contributors to endothelial dysfunction, a key early event in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Our study aimed to evaluate the relationship between total homocysteine (tHcy) levels and traditional cardiovascular risk factors in overweight and obese adolescents. We enrolled 42 obese, 14 overweight, and 25 non-obese children. No significant differences in tHcy levels were observed between overweight, obese, and non-obese adolescents. Homocysteine positively correlated with age (r = 0.433, p < 0.011) and creatinine concentrations (r = 0.363, p = 0.001) in the overall group of overweight, obese, and non-obese children, as well as in the combined group of overweight and obese children (for age: r = 0.275, p = 0.025; for creatinine: r = 0.278, p = 0.025). We did not find any association between homocysteine and atherogenic lipid profile, insulin-resistance status, blood pressure, and inflammatory parameters in overweight and obese patients. Age emerged as the strongest independent predictor of homocysteine levels. The observed association with creatine suggests a potential renal contribution to homocysteine metabolism.",Cardiovascular Risk

40868294,From Petri Dish to Primitive Heart: How IVF Alters Early Cardiac Gene Networks and Epigenetic Landscapes.,"Numerous infants have been conceived by in vitro fertilization (IVF) and other assisted reproductive technologies (ART). Increasing evidence indicates that these approaches induce minor alterations in molecules during the initial phases of embryogenesis. This narrative review examines the molecular pathophysiology of embryonic cardiogenesis in the context of assisted reproductive technology, emphasizing transcriptional and epigenetic regulation. Essential transcription factors for cardiac development, including NKX2-5, GATA4, TBX5, ISL1, MEF2C, and HAND1/2, play a crucial role in mesodermal specification, heart tube formation, and chamber morphogenesis. Animal models and human preimplantation embryos have demonstrated that ART-related procedures, including gamete micromanipulation, supraphysiological hormone exposure, and extended in vitro culture, can alter the expression or epigenetic programming of these genes. Subsequent to ART, researchers have identified anomalous patterns of DNA methylation, alterations in histones, and modifications in chromatin accessibility in cardiogenic loci. These alterations indicate that errors occurred during the initial reprogramming process, potentially resulting in structural congenital heart abnormalities (CHDs) or modifications in cardiac function later in life. Analysis of the placental epigenome in babies conceived using assisted reproductive technology reveals that imprinted and developmental genes critical for cardiac development remain dysfunctional. This review proposes a mechanistic theory about the potential subtle alterations in the cardiogenic gene network induced by ART, synthesizing findings from molecular embryology, transcriptomics, and epigenomics. Understanding these molecular issues is crucial not only for enhancing ART protocols but also for evaluating the cardiovascular risk of children conceived by ART postnatally and for early intervention.",Cardiovascular Risk
40868239,Trends in Utilization of Guideline-Directed Cardiorenal Protective Therapies for Chronic Kidney Disease in Patients with Cardiovascular Morbidity: Real World Data from Two Cross-Sectional Snapshots (HECMOS I and II).,"Introduction: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects roughly 10% of the global population and significantly increases cardiovascular risk. While renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi) remain a therapeutic mainstay, recent evidence supports the renoprotective value of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and finerenone. This study evaluated the real-world use of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) among patients with cardiorenal disease in Greece and explored factors influencing prescribing patterns. Methods: The Hellenic Cardiorenal Morbidity Snapshots (HECMOS 1 and 2) enrolled all cardiology inpatients across Greece on 3 March, 2022, and 5 June, 2024. Comorbidities and medication data were based on self-report and chart review. CKD patients eligible for SGLT2i and finerenone were identified per guideline criteria. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of SGLT2i use. Results: From a total of 923 and 1222 patients enrolled in HECMOS 1 and 2, CKD was present in 26% and 27%, respectively. SGLT2i use prior to hospitalization rose from 15% in HECMOS 1 to 30.4% in HECMOS 2. In HECMOS 1, diabetes mellitus was the strongest predictor of SGLT2i use (OR 12.01, 95% CI 3.31-45.56, p < 0.001), while heart failure predicted use in HECMOS 2 (OR 4.10, 95% CI 1.70-9.88, p = 0.002). Finerenone was prescribed in only 1.7% of eligible patients in HECMOS 2. RASi usage among CKD patients remained stable across both cohorts (42.1% vs. 41.7%), with renal dysfunction showing no impact on prescribing patterns. Conclusions: SGLT2i use in patients with CKD and cardiovascular disease doubled over 2 years, indicating progress in implementing GDMT. However, overall use of disease-modifying therapies remains suboptimal, underscoring the need for further improvement in real-world care.",Cardiovascular Risk
40868202,Effects of Novel Nutraceutical Combination on Lipid Pattern of Subjects with Sub-Optimal Blood Cholesterol Levels.,"Background/Objectives: High concentration of plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is the predominant cause of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease progression and coronary heart disease. Nutraceutical combination together with a cholesterol-lowering action provides an alternative to pharmacotherapy in patients reporting intolerance to statins and in subjects with low cardiovascular risk. The effects on lipid parameters were evaluated over 6 months for a food supplement containing aqueous extract of Berberis aristata and Olea europea, fenugreek seed extract, water/ethanol extract of artichoke leaf and phytosterols from sunflower seeds (Ritmon Colesystem®). Methods: Laboratory data were obtained at baseline from 44 otherwise healthy subjects (33 males, mean 50 ± 11 years) without cardiovascular disease having LDL-C in the range 115 to 190 mg/dL pharmacologically untreated for hypercholesterolemia. Subjects were re-evaluated at 1, 3 and 6 months during which they took one tablet of Ritmon Colesystem® after dinner. Results: At baseline, the mean values were 151 ± 21 mg/dL for LDL-C, 223 ± 24 mg/dL for total cholesterol (T-C), 52 ± 14 mg/dL for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and 124 ± 58 mg/dL for triglycerides. A significant reduction in LDL-C was observed; 9 mg/dL (95% confidence interval 3-14), 10 (4-17) and 7 (1-14) at 1, 3 and 6 months. A similar significant trend was detected for T-C while triglycerides did not show significant changes and HDL-C had lower values only at 3 months. Conclusions: These nutraceuticals in individuals with sub-optimal blood cholesterol levels at intermediate-low cardiovascular risk reduced LDL-C and T-C over 6 months contributing to the improvement of cholesterol control by dietary supplements.",Cardiovascular Risk
40868130,"Correlations Between Coffee Intake, Glycemic Control, Cardiovascular Risk, and Sleep in Type 2 Diabetes and Hypertension: A 12-Month Observational Study.","Background: The consumption of coffee has been widely debated regarding its effects on health. This study aims to analyze the correlations between daily coffee intake and sleep, blood pressure, anthropometric measurements, and biochemical markers in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and hypertension over a 12-month period. Methods: An observational study was conducted with 40 participants with T2D and hypertension, comprising 20 females and 20 males. Participants were monitored for their daily coffee consumption over a 12-month period, being assessed every 3 months. Linear regression was utilized to assess interactions and relationships between variables, providing insights into potential predictive associations. Additionally, correlation analysis was performed using Pearson's and Spearman's tests to evaluate the strength and direction of linear and non-linear relationships. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results: Significant changes were observed in fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), body weight, body mass index, sleep duration, nocturnal awakenings, and waist-to-hip ratio (p < 0.05) over the 12-month study in both sexes. No significant differences were noted in the remaining parameters (p > 0.05). The coffee consumed by the participants was of the ""traditional type"" and contained sugar (2 g per cup) for 100% of the participants. An intake of 4.17 ± 0.360 cups per day was found at baseline and 5.41 ± 0.316 cups at 12 months (p > 0.05). Regarding correlation analysis, a higher coffee intake was significantly associated with shorter sleep duration in women (r = -0.731; p = 0.037). Conversely, greater coffee consumption correlated with lower LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in women (r = -0.820; p = 0.044). Additionally, a longer sleep duration was linked to lower FBG (r = -0.841; p = 0.031), HbA1c (r = -0.831; p = 0.037), and LDL-C levels in women (r = -0.713; p = 0.050). No significant correlations were observed for the other parameters in both sexes (p > 0.05). Conclusions: In women, coffee consumption may negatively affect sleep duration while potentially offering beneficial effects on LDL-C levels, even when sweetened with sugar. Additionally, a longer sleep duration in women appears to be associated with improvements in FBG, HbA1c, and LDL-C. These correlations emphasize the importance of a balanced approach to coffee consumption, weighing both its potential health benefits and drawbacks in postmenopausal women. However, since this study does not establish causality, further randomized clinical trials are warranted to investigate the underlying mechanisms and long-term implications-particularly in the context of T2D and hypertension.",Cardiovascular Risk
40868118,Pathophysiological Links Between Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Cardiovascular Disease: The Role of Dysbiosis and Emerging Biomarkers.,"This review introduces a novel integrative framework linking gut dysbiosis, systemic inflammation, and cardiovascular risk in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We highlight emerging biomarkers, including short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), calprotectin, and zonulin, that reflect alterations in the gut microbiome and increased intestinal permeability, which contribute to cardiovascular pathology. Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and recent evidence identifies IBD, encompassing ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), as a significant non-traditional risk factor for CVD. This review synthesizes current knowledge on how dysbiosis-driven inflammation in IBD patients exacerbates endothelial dysfunction, hypercoagulability, and atherosclerosis, even in the absence of traditional risk factors. Additionally, we discuss how commonly used IBD therapies may modulate cardiovascular risk. Understanding these multifactorial mechanisms and validating reliable biomarkers are essential for improving cardiovascular risk stratification and guiding targeted prevention strategies in this vulnerable population.",Cardiovascular Risk
40867871,Association Between Oxidative-Inflammation Biomarkers and Incident Chronic Kidney Disease in People with High Cardiovascular Risk: A Nested Case-Control Study.,"Aim: To assess oxidative-inflammatory biomarker prediction of incident CKD after 1-year follow-up in a population with overweight/obesity and metabolic syndrome. Methods: Prospective nested case-control study comprising 117 CKD incident cases and 117 matched controls free of CKD after 1-year follow-up conducted in 55-75-year-old participants. Controls were time-matched 1:1 to cases by intervention group, age (≤65 vs. >65 years), and sex. Serum creatinine (SCr), cystatin C (CyC), and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) were measured at baseline, and CKD Epidemiology Collaboration equations for Caucasians were used to assess SCr, CyC, and CyC-SCr-based estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR). Baseline levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), carbonyls, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-1ra, IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), and leptin were determined from fasting serum samples. An inflammatory-oxidative stress score based on these biomarkers was calculated. Incident CKD was defined by eGFR-SCr <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and/or UACR ≥30 mg/g in the absence of CKD at baseline. Results: UACR positively correlated with pro-inflammatory markers (IL-1β; TNFα) and oxidative damage marker (MDA); eGFR-cyC showed negative correlations with IL-1β and IL-1ra, and eGFR-SCr with leptin. The odds ratios (OR; 95% CI) for incident CKD in the highest vs. the lowest tertile of IL-1ra IL-6 and TNFα were (2.22; 1.22-4.04), (7.03; 2.88-17.14), and (3.79; 1.79-8.02), respectively. The inflammatory-oxidative stress score was associated with incident CKD (OR per 1-SD increment: 2.06; 1.49-2.83). Conclusions: Inflammatory/oxidative stress is associated with CKD incidence in individuals with high cardiovascular risk, underscoring the importance in identify early inflammation to prevent this disease.",Cardiovascular Risk
40867510,Myocardial Infarction in Young Adults: A Case Series and Comprehensive Review of Molecular and Clinical Mechanisms.,"Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in young adults, though less common than in older populations, is an emerging clinical concern with increasing incidence and diverse etiologies. Unlike classic atherosclerotic presentations, a significant proportion of AMI cases in individuals under 45 years are due to nonatherothrombotic mechanisms such as coronary vasospasm, spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD), vasculitis, hypercoagulable states, and drug-induced coronary injury. This manuscript aims to explore the multifactorial nature of AMI in young adults through a focused review of current evidence and a series of illustrative clinical cases. We present and analyze four distinct cases of young patients with AMI, each demonstrating different pathophysiological mechanisms and risk profiles-including premature atherosclerosis, substance use, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related coronary disease, and SCAD. Despite the heterogeneity of underlying causes, early diagnosis, individualized management, and aggressive secondary prevention were key to favorable outcomes. Advanced imaging, lipid profiling, and risk factor modification played a central role in guiding therapy. AMI in young adults requires heightened clinical suspicion and a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach. Early intervention and recognition of nontraditional risk factors are essential to improving outcomes and preventing recurrent events in this vulnerable population.",Cardiovascular Risk
40867136,Differences in Cerebral Small Vessel Disease Magnetic Resonance Imaging Depending on Cardiovascular Risk Factors: A Retrospective Cross-Sectional Study.,"Background: Vascular risk factors (VRFs) are known to influence cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) burden and progression. However, their specific impact on the presence and distribution of each cSVD imaging marker (white matter hyperintensity [WMH], perivascular spaces [PVSs], lacunes, and cerebral microbleeds [CMBs]) and their spatial distribution remains unclear. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 93 patients with lacunar stroke with a standardized investigational magnetic resonance imaging protocol using a 3T scanner. WMH and PVSs were segmented semi-automatically, and lacunes and CMBs were manually segmented. We assessed the univariable associations of four common VRFs (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and smoking) with the load of each cSVD marker. Then, we assessed the independent associations of these VRFs in multivariable regression models adjusted for age and sex. Spatial lesion patterns were explored with regional volumetric comparisons using Pearson's coefficient analysis, which was adjusted for multiple comparisons, and by visually examining heatmap lesion distributions. Results: Hypertension was the VRF that exhibited stronger associations with the cSVD markers in the univariable analysis. In the multivariable analysis, only lacunes (p = 0.009) and PVSs in the basal ganglia (p = 0.014) and white matter (p = 0.016) were still associated with hypertension. In the regional analysis, hypertension showed a higher WMH load in deep structures and white matter, particularly in the posterior periventricular regions. In patients with hyperlipidemia, WMH was preferentially found in hippocampal regions. Conclusions: Hypertension was confirmed to be the VRF with the most impact on cSVD load, especially for lacunes and PVSs, while the lesion topography was variable for each VRF. These findings shed light on the complexity of cSVD expression in relation to factors detrimental to vascular health.",Cardiovascular Risk

40864818,Circadian Rhythm Disruptions and Cardiovascular Disease Risk: The Special Role of Melatonin.,"Circadian rhythms are endogenous biological cycles that regulate essential cardiovascular functions, including blood pressure, heart rate, vascular tone, and metabolic homeostasis. Disruption of these rhythms due to factors such as shift work, artificial light at night, irregular sleep-wake cycles, or mistimed eating has been increasingly recognized as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. A growing body of evidence links circadian misalignment to key pathophysiological mechanisms, including endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation, and autonomic imbalance. Melatonin, a hormone produced primarily by the pineal gland, plays a central role in circadian regulation and exhibits potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cardiometabolic properties. This narrative review synthesizes current findings on the interplay between circadian disruption and cardiovascular risk, with a particular emphasis on the mechanistic and therapeutic role of melatonin. We also highlight the potential of chronotherapeutic strategies, such as timed melatonin supplementation, antihypertensive dosing, and time-restricted eating, to restore circadian alignment and improve cardiovascular outcomes. Despite promising data, translation into clinical practice remains limited. Future research should focus on identifying practical circadian biomarkers, refining chronotherapy protocols, and integrating circadian variables into risk models and clinical workflows.",Cardiovascular Risk

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of MetS and its associated factors among Malagasy patients with ischemic stroke. Materials and methods This cross-sectional study was conducted over a three-year period at the Soavinandriana Hospital Center, Antananarivo, Madagascar. MetS was defined according to the International Diabetes Federation's 2009 criteria. Ischemic stroke was confirmed by brain computerized tomography. The TOAST classification was used to determine the etiologies. Results We included 307 patients with ischemic stroke. The prevalence of MetS was 77.9%. According to the logistic regression analysis, the factors associated with MetS were female gender (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 3.99, p-value = 0.0031), hypertension (aOR = 4.02, p-value = 0.0029), overweight or obesity (aOR = 2.13, p-value = 0.0122), diabetes (aOR = 4.20, p-value = 0.0011), Glasgow scale ≤10 (aOR = 2.18, p-value = 0.0157), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) ≥15 (aOR = 2.94, p-value = 0.0086), and modified Rankin scale ≥ 3 (aOR = 2.29, p-value = 0.0033). As components of MetS, elevated blood pressure was significantly associated with overweight or obesity (aOR = 1.97, p-value = 0.0440), large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) (aOR = 10.2, p-value = 0.0256), and cardioembolism (aOR = 0.25, p-value = 0.0177). The associations between elevated fasting glucose and LAA (aOR = 2.26, p-value = 0.0012) and cardioembolism (aOR = 0.34, p-value = 0.0004). Elevated triglycerides was associated significantly with diabetes (aOR = 2.01, p-value = 0.0452), cardioembolism (aOR = 0.45, p-value = 0.0115), and lacunar infarcts (aOR = 3.05, p-value = 0.0336). Conclusion Screening for MetS should be a routine part of assessing patients with ischemic stroke. Proper management of MetS and its components could lead to improvements in the profile and prognosis of ischemic stroke.",Cardiovascular Risk

The development of multiparametric scores for coronary risk stratification, integrated with artificial intelligence (AI), is important because it facilitates assessment in clinical practice. Therefore, prognostic coronary risk scores that incorporate multiple clinical variables and cardiac imaging data are necessary and deserve greater attention, as they provide a more comprehensive and accurate evaluation of individual patient risk across various clinical scenarios. Additionally, they support clinicians in making better-informed decisions based on a comprehensive assessment. Importantly, the widespread clinical use of multiparametric risk scores should be enabled by implementing standardized computer interfaces that can exchange the relevant imaging and clinical data needed to calculate these scores.

MZL is the prototype for an antigen-driven malignancy, and there are clear areas where elimination of the antigenic trigger leads to lymphoma regression. Although there is an excellent prognosis, the disease remains incurable, and the majority of patients will need repeated therapy for disease control over the course of their lifetime. Current treatment paradigms include rituximab monotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy in the frontline setting. In the relapsed or refractory setting, there are exciting advances including the recent approval of the covalent BTK inhibitor, zanubrutinib.

Part 2: Treatment - Update 2024.,"A unique collaboration of multi-disciplinary experts from the European Association of Dermato-Oncology (EADO), the European Dermatology Forum (EDF), and the European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) was formed to make recommendations on cutaneous melanoma diagnosis and treatment, based on systematic literature reviews and the experts' experience. Cutaneous melanomas are excised with one to two-centimeter safety margins. For a correct stage classification and treatment decision, a sentinel lymph node biopsy shall be offered in patients with tumor thickness ≥ 1.0 mm or ≥ 0.8 mm with additional histological risk factors, although there is as yet no clear survival benefit for this approach. Therapeutic decisions should be primarily made by an interdisciplinary oncology team (""Tumor Board""). Adjuvant therapies can be proposed in completely resected stage IIB-IV. In stage II only PD-1 inhibitors are approved. In stage III anti-PD-1 therapy or dabrafenib plus trametinib for patients with BRAFV600 mutated melanoma can be discussed. In resected stage IV, nivolumab can be offered, as well as ipilimumab and nivolumab, in selected, high-risk patients. In patients with clinically detected macroscopic, resectable disease, neoadjuvant therapy with ipilimumab plus nivolumab followed complete surgical resection and adjuvant therapy according to pathological response and BRAF status can be offered. Neoadjuvant therapy with pembrolizumab followed by complete surgical resection and adjuvant pembrolizumab is also recommended. For patients with disease recurrence after (neo) adjuvant therapy, further treatment should consider the type of (neo) adjuvant therapy received as well as the time of recurrence, i.e., on or off therapy. In patients with irresectable stage III/IV disease systemic treatment is always indicated. For first line treatment PD-1 antibodies alone or in combination with CTLA-4 or LAG-3 antibodies shall be considered. In stage IV melanoma with a BRAFV600 mutation, first-line therapy with BRAF/MEK inhibitors can be offered as an alternative to immunotherapy, in selected cases. In patients with primary resistance to immunotherapy and harboring a BRAFV600 mutation, this therapy shall be offered as second line. Other second line therapies include therapy with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and combinations of immune checkpoint inhibitors not used in first line. This guideline is valid until the end of 2026.",Oncology Treatment Update
39561966,Hepatocellular carcinoma systemic treatment update: From early to advanced stage.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks the sixth most common malignancy but the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the world. Significant breakthroughs have been made in systemic treatment for HCC over the past two decades, which have improved treatment outcomes. In addition to multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors (mTKIs), immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and antiangiogenic drugs are increasingly being applied. The combination of ICI and antiangiogenic or dual ICIs has become the new standard of care due to remarkable response rates. However, currently available systemic regimens are primarily reserved for certain patients in the intermediate and advanced stages who will not benefit from locoregional treatments. Evidence supporting the use of systemic treatment as neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapies in patients with early-stage HCC, especially the high risk of recurrence after curative treatments, remains limited. This review identified recent developments in systemic therapy, including mTKIs and ICIs, considering results on first- and second-line treatment, role of neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings, and combination with loco-regional therapy. Various ongoing clinical trials regarding the role of systemic therapies and potential novel targets in patients with early-, intermediate-, and advanced-stage HCC were also summarized and revealed that systemic therapy is no longer limited to advanced-stage HCC. Moreover, the introduction of T-cell redirecting strategies, including bispecific antibodies and chimeric antigen receptor T cells, has revolutionized the treatment landscape for HCC.

Although the incidence has declined with increased screening and higher uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in high-income countries, this disease remains the second highest cause of cancer mortality among women in low- and middle-income countries. In this clinical practice statement, we describe therapies for cervical cancer by treatment setting, as well as quality of life, financial toxicity, and disparities associated with this disease. In addition to chemotherapy and radiation, therapeutic strategies for cervical cancer include immune checkpoint blockade, antiangiogenics, and antibody-drug conjugates. Optimal treatment for recurrent cervical cancer remains an area of unmet need, necessitating further exploration of rational and innovative treatment approaches, including cell and immune-based therapies. Importantly, development of effective therapies for cervical cancer must incorporate strategies to ensure universal equitable access to HPV vaccination, screening, and treatment. Important consequences of the disease and treatment that impact quality of life must also be addressed. Patients with cervical cancer are at increased risk for financial toxicity, which can lead to downstream detrimental effects on physical, financial, and career outcomes. Underrepresentation of racial and ethnic minorities in gynecologic oncology clinical trials highlights the urgent need for collaborative and focused initiatives to bridge the significant divide and alleviate inequalities in the prevention and treatment of cervical cancer.",Oncology Treatment Update
37708630,European consensus-based interdisciplinary guideline for invasive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma: Part 2. Treatment-Update 2023.,"In order to update recommendations on treatment, supportive care, education, and follow-up of patients with invasive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), a multidisciplinary panel of experts from the European Association of Dermato-Oncology (EADO), the European Dermatology Forum (EDF), the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO), the European Union of Medical Specialists (UEMS), the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV), and the European Organisation of Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) was formed. Recommendations were based on an evidence-based literature review, guidelines, and expert consensus. Treatment recommendations are presented for common primary cSCC (low risk, high risk), locally advanced cSCC, regional metastatic cSCC (operable or inoperable), and distant metastatic cSCC. For common primary cSCC, the first-line treatment is surgical excision with postoperative margin assessment or micrographically controlled surgery. Achieving clear surgical margins is the most important treatment consideration for patients with cSCCs amenable to surgery. Regarding adjuvant radiotherapy for patients with high-risk localised cSCC with clear surgical margins, current evidence has not shown significant benefit for those with at least one high-risk factor. Radiotherapy should be considered as the primary treatment for non-surgical candidates/tumours. For cSCC with cytologically or histologically confirmed regional nodal metastasis, lymph node dissection is recommended. For patients with metastatic or locally advanced cSCC who are not candidates for curative surgery or radiotherapy, anti-PD-1 agents are the first-line systemic treatment, with cemiplimab being the first approved systemic agent for advanced cSCC by the Food and Drugs Administration/European Medicines Agency. Second-line systemic treatments for advanced cSCC, include epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (cetuximab) combined with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Multidisciplinary board decisions are mandatory for all patients with advanced cSCC, considering the risks of toxicity, the age and frailty of patients, and co-morbidities, including immunosuppression. Patients should be engaged in informed, shared decision-making on management and be provided with the best supportive care to improve symptom management and quality of life. The frequency of follow-up visits and investigations for subsequent new cSCC depends on underlying risk characteristics.",Oncology Treatment Update

40869625,First-Trimester Clinical Characteristics and Pregnancy Outcomes in Women with Recurrent Pregnancy Loss.,"Objective: To describe first-trimester maternal, biochemical, biophysical, and ultrasound characteristics in women with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) compared to women without RPL. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study analyzing data from 4440 pregnant women, including 142 women with previous RPL. Maternal and pregnancy characteristics, first-trimester biochemical markers, biophysical assessments, early-onset preeclampsia (EOPE) risk, and perinatal outcomes were compared. Results: Women with RPL were older (37.8 vs. 34.0 years, p < 0.001) and had higher rates of antiphospholipid syndrome (4.9% vs. 0.9%, p < 0.001), other thrombophilias (5.6% vs. 0.8%, p < 0.001), and thyroid disorders (14% vs. 7.5%, p = 0.010) than women without RPL. First-trimester uterine artery pulsatility index (UtA-PI) values, pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) levels, mean arterial pressure, and final risk for EOPE were comparable between groups. However, the RPL group had higher rates of very high risk for PE (10.6 vs. 5.1, p = 0.011). Likewise, second-trimester UtA-PI was higher in this group (1.10 vs. 1.01, p = 0.045). Aspirin and low molecular weight heparin prophylaxis were more frequent in women with RPL (23.8% vs. 9.6%, p < 0.001; 14.7% vs. 0.1%, p < 0.001). Regarding perinatal outcomes, we found a higher incidence of second-trimester intrauterine demise in the RPL group (6.4% vs. 1.4%, p = 0.011), with no other differences observed in the remaining outcomes. Conclusions: Women with RPL exhibit distinct maternal characteristics and worse pregnancy outcomes, although first-trimester markers do not seem to significantly differ from findings in women without RPL. These findings underscore the importance of tailored screening and intervention protocols to improve perinatal outcomes in this high-risk population.",Thyroid Disorders
40880316,Investigation the Impact of KCNE1-rs1805127 Polymorphism on Cardiac Patients with Atrial Fibrillation.,"Objective: This study aimed to investigate the association between the KCNE1 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP: rs1805127; T>C transition; S38G substitution) and atrial fibrillation (AF) in the Mazandaran population of northern Iran. Materials and Methods: To conduct this case-control study, 120 blood samples from healthy individuals and 120 from individuals with AF were collected over an 11-month period. All participants underwent electrocardiogram analysis by a cardiologist. In addition, they completed a questionnaire that included questions about their medical history, lifestyle factors, and current medications. Genotyping of KCNE1-rs1805127 was performed using the restriction fragment length polymorphism method. The impact of KCNE1-rs1805127 on protein stability, function, and mRNA secondary structure was assessed using SIFT, I-Mutant, MetaRNN, and RNAsnp servers. Results: The results revealed a significant association of the CC genotype and C allele with AF (CC genotype: p value = 0.035; C allele: p value = 0.042). Furthermore, an association was observed between smoking (p value = 0.018), hypertension (p value = 0.046), and thyroid disorders (p value = 0.040) and AF. in silico predictions indicated that KCNE1-rs1805127 may impair protein function, reduce stability, and alter mRNA secondary structure. Conclusions: Based on the results obtained, KCNE1-rs1805127 may increase the risk of AF, particularly in the presence of risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, and thyroid disorders. Notably, in silico predictions from computational tools validate this observed impact. Given the role of the KCNE1 gene in modulating ion channels and cardiac electrophysiology, we suggest that further research on KCNE1 and its SNPs could provide valuable insights into its role in the pathogenesis of cardiac arrhythmias, particularly AF.",Thyroid Disorders
40863211,Subclinical Hypothyroidism in Moderate-to-Severe Psoriasis: A Cross-Sectional Study of Prevalence and Clinical Implications.,"Background: Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease linked to systemic comorbidities, including metabolic, cardiovascular, and autoimmune disorders. Thyroid dysfunction, particularly hypothyroidism, has been observed in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, suggesting possible shared inflammatory pathways. Objectives: This study aims to explore the relationship between psoriasis and thyroid dysfunction in adults with moderate-to-severe psoriasis undergoing biologic therapy to determine whether psoriasis predisposes individuals to thyroid disorders and to identify demographic or clinical factors influencing this association. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study included adult patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis receiving biologic therapy, recruited from the Psoriasis Unit at the Dermatology Department of Hospital Universitario San Cecilio in Granada, Spain, from 2017 to 2023. Patients with mild psoriasis or those treated with conventional systemic therapies were excluded. The data collected included demographics and clinical characteristics, such as age, sex, BMI (body mass index), and psoriasis severity (psoriasis severity was evaluated using the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI), body surface area (BSA) involvement, Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA), pruritus severity using the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), and impact on quality of life through the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)). Thyroid dysfunction, including hypothyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism, was assessed based on records from the Endocrinology Department. Results: Thyroid dysfunction was found in 4.2% of patients, all classified as hypothyroidism, primarily subclinical. The affected patients were generally older, with a mean age of 57.4 years. No significant differences in psoriasis severity (PASI, BSA) or treatment response were observed between patients with and without thyroid dysfunction. Conclusion: Our findings suggest hypothyroidism is the main thyroid dysfunction in psoriatic patients, independent of psoriasis severity. The lack of impact on psoriasis severity suggests hypothyroidism may be an independent comorbidity, warranting further research into shared inflammatory mechanisms.",Thyroid Disorders

40852830,Complex-Valued Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolution Neural Network optimized With Giraffe Kicking Optimization Algorithm for Thyroid Nodule Classification in Ultrasound Images.,"Thyroid hormones are significant for controlling metabolism, and two common thyroid disorders, such as hypothyroidism. The hyperthyroidism are directly affect the metabolic rate of the human body. Predicting and diagnosing thyroid disease remain significant challenges in medical research due to the complexity of thyroid hormone regulation and its impact on metabolism. Therefore, this paper proposes a Complex-valued Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolution Neural Network optimized with Giraffe Kicking Optimization Algorithm for Thyroid Nodule Classification in Ultrasound Images (CSGCNN-GKOA-TNC-UI). Here, the ultrasound images are collected through DDTI (Digital Database of Thyroid ultrasound Imageries) dataset. The gathered data is given into the pre-processing stage using Bilinear Double-Order Filter (BDOF) approach to eradicate the noise and increase the input images quality. The pre-processing image is given into the Deep Adaptive Fuzzy Clustering (DAFC) for Region of Interest (RoI) segmentation. The segmented image is fed to the Multi-Objective Matched Synchro Squeezing Chirplet Transform (MMSSCT) for extracting the features, like Geometric features and Morphological features. The extracted features are fed into the CSGCNN, which classifies the Thyroid Nodule into Benign Nodules and Malign Nodules. Finally, Giraffe Kicking Optimization Algorithm (GKOA) is considered to enhance the CSGCNN classifier. The CSGCNN-GKOA-TNC-UI algorithm is implemented in MATLAB. The CSGCNN-GKOA-TNC-UI approach attains 34.9%, 21.5% and 26.8% higher f-score, 18.6%, 29.3 and 19.2% higher accuracy when compared with existing models: Thyroid diagnosis with classification utilizing DNN depending on hybrid meta-heuristic with LSTM method (LSTM-TNC-UI), innovative full-scale connected network for segmenting thyroid nodule in UI (FCG Net-TNC-UI), and Adversarial architecture dependent multi-scale fusion method for segmenting thyroid nodule (AMSeg-TNC-UI) methods respectively.

40802006,Signal mining for non-bleeding adverse event in novel oral anticoagulants: a pharmacovigilance study based on FAERS database.,"Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are extensively utilized in clinical practice; however, their associated non-bleeding adverse reactions have not been adequately emphasized. This study is based on the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database and analyzes adverse events associated with NOACs from a real-world perspective, particularly focusing on non-bleeding adverse reaction signals, to assess differences in the safety of NOACs and provide early warnings for clinical practice. This study obtained raw data from the FAERS database, ranging from July 1, 2014, to March 31, 2024. The data were deduplicated and merged. The reporting odds ratio (ROR) and Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN) methods were employed to detect potential signals between NOACs and adverse events (AEs). This study reveals several new and severe adverse reaction signals, indicating non-bleeding adverse effects should receive greater attention when using NOACs. Specifically, significant adverse reaction signals were observed in three organ systems: congenital, familial, and genetic disorders; pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions; along with blood and lymphatic system disorders. Furthermore, there are differences in safety among NOACs, and each NOAC has its own unique AEs. For example, dabigatran is associated with adverse reactions including incarcerated inguinal hernia strangulated, macular fibrosis, potassium imbalance, acidosis, and mental status changes. For apixaban, there is a need for caution due to potential adverse reactions including visual impairment, benign prostatic hyperplasia, thyroid disorders, and sleep disturbances. Concerning edoxaban, practitioners should be vigilant about potential adverse effects such as lymphatic disorder, dysuria, diplopia, rash morbilliform, and delirium. Additionally, rivaroxaban may lead to complications such as thrombocytosis, alopecia, prostatic varices, menstrual irregularities, adrenomegaly, and organic brain syndrome. This study has found that the non-bleeding adverse events associated with NOACs are linked to multiple organ systems, which requires high vigilance in clinical practice, especially for some easily overlooked systems such as the reproductive system and breast disorders, endocrine disorders, and psychiatric disorders. This research provides important insights into the adverse reactions related to NOACs, highlighting the diversity of their safety profiles.",Thyroid Disorders

However, gaps remain, particularly in the availability of essential diagnostics such as thyroid function tests, which are critical for identifying high-risk pregnancies (HRPs). This study explores the proportion of missed at-risk pregnancies due to undiagnosed thyroid disorders and the associated out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) in rural Andhra Pradesh. Methodology A convergent parallel mixed-methods design was adopted, combining a cross-sectional study with focus group discussions and in-depth interviews. Quantitative data were collected from 96 pregnant women attending primary health centers (PHCs). Qualitative insights were gathered from healthcare providers and pregnant women with missed thyroid disorder diagnoses. The study was conducted over a one-year period (2024-2025) across four PHCs in Mangalagiri Mandal, Andhra Pradesh, India. Blood samples for thyroid function testing were collected at the PHCs and transported to a central laboratory at a tertiary care facility using drone technology. Results The study included women with a mean age of 24.0 years, most of whom were housewives with at least a high school education. Among them, 59% had not undergone prior thyroid testing, and 5% were found to have undiagnosed hypothyroidism. Women without prior testing were more likely to be in their first trimester and classified as HRPs. Most diagnostic investigations were performed at private facilities, with thyroid-stimulating hormone testing costing a median of ₹500.

Here, we describe the frequency of underlying diagnoses and focus on cases in which the identification of analytical interferences led to the discovery of lymphoproliferative disorders. Methods: This is a retrospective cross-sectional study including all consecutive patients referred to the Department of Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, Istituto Auxologico Italiano, for suspected central hyperthyroidism between January 2017 and February 2025. Inclusion criteria were based on laboratory findings of (1) elevated or inappropriately normal thyrotropin (TSH) with high FT4 and/or FT3, (2) elevated TSH with FT4 in the upper reference range, and (3) failure of TSH to normalize despite levothyroxine therapy, along with rising FT4 levels. The differential diagnosis was made by (1) reassessment of discrepant results in the hormone panel by different analytical methods or tandem mass spectrometry; (2) serum serial dilution or polyethylene glycol precipitation; (3) evaluation of rheumatoid factor, serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), and cryoglobulins; and (4) deep clinical phenotyping and/or confirmatory genetic testing, as appropriate. Results: Among 144 patients referred for discordant TFTs mimicking central hyperthyroidism, 44% were genuine rare thyroid disorders-32% with resistance to thyroid hormone beta (RTHβ), 7% with TSH-secreting adenomas, and 5% other diagnosis-and 56% had assay interference. In this latter group, interfering clonal paraproteins were detected in 6/81 cases. One patient was ultimately diagnosed with multiple myeloma, another one with type 1 cryoglobulinemia due to indolent marginal zone B non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and the remaining four cases were found to have monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance. The clonal paraprotein was an IgM kappa/lambda in five cases and IgG kappa or IgA kappa in one case, respectively. Conclusions: In patients referred for discordant TFTs, RTHβ is the most prevalent thyroid disorder, but variable assay interferences represent the most frequent condition. In these cases, SPEP and hematological investigations are highly recommended.",Thyroid Disorders

40732987,Thyroid Health and Selenium: The Critical Role of Adequate Intake from Fetal Development to Adolescence.,"The thyroid gland plays a crucial role in regulating metabolism and supporting development through the production of the hormones T4 and T3. These hormones are essential during childhood for nervous system myelination, physical growth, puberty, skeletal and dental maturation, and overall metabolic balance. In early infancy, when the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis is still immature, thyroid dysfunction can result in a range of long-term complications. The metabolism and action of thyroid hormones depend not only on iodine but also on other vital micronutrients, particularly selenium (Se). This narrative review aims to comprehensively examine the role of selenium in maintaining thyroid health from fetal life through adolescence. Selenium is a key micronutrient involved in thyroid development, hormone synthesis, antioxidant defense, and immune regulation, especially during pregnancy and childhood. Inadequate selenium levels may contribute to the onset, progression, and clinical management of various thyroid disorders, particularly hypothyroidism and autoimmune thyroid diseases. Although scientific evidence supports selenium's critical functions in hormone metabolism and antioxidant protection, public awareness and monitoring of selenium intake remain insufficient. Beyond the need for further research, there is an urgent call for integrated public health strategies, ranging from sustainable, food-based approaches to targeted clinical screening and educational programs. Promoting awareness of selenium's importance and incorporating selenium status into maternal and pediatric care protocols could play a significant role in preventing deficiencies and supporting long-term endocrine and neurodevelopmental health.",Thyroid Disorders
40728470,[Nutritional deficiencies in women and their impact on thyroid disorders].,"Hypothyroidism is an endocrine disorder characterized by insufficient production of thyroid hormones (TH), with a significantly higher prevalence in women. The pathophysiology of this condition is influenced by genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors, including nutritional imbalances. Several micronutrients, such as iodine, iron, selenium, zinc, and vitamin D, play a key role in the synthesis, peripheral conversion, and action of TH. Women are more vulnerable to these deficiencies due to specific nutritional requirements, which increases their susceptibility to thyroid dysfunction, particularly during stages such as pregnancy or the postpartum period. Current evidence supports the assessment of nutritional status as a complement to conventional pharmacological treatment with levothyroxine (LT4), especially in women with subclinical hypothyroidism or autoimmune thyroid diseases. An appropriate nutritional intervention could play a crucial role in enhancing therapeutic response and improving disease management.",Thyroid Disorders
40723084,"Quality-of-Life Outcomes Following Thyroid Surgery in Pediatric Patients: A Systematic Review of Physical, Emotional, and Social Dimensions.","Background: Thyroid disorders are significant endocrine conditions in pediatric populations, sometimes requiring surgical intervention. While surgical outcomes are well-documented, the broader impact on quality of life (QoL) remains insufficiently synthesized. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effects of thyroid surgery on QoL in pediatric patients, focusing on physical, emotional, and social dimensions. Methods: Following the PRISMA guidelines, we searched PubMed, EMBASE, and SCOPUS from inception to January 2025. Studies reporting health-related QoL outcomes in pediatric patients undergoing thyroid surgery were included. Quality assessment was conducted using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Data synthesis focused on emotional and psychological outcomes, social functioning, physical health, and surgical-approach-specific effects. Results: Five studies (ranging from 37 to 92 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Unilateral thyroidectomy was associated with better QoL outcomes compared to bilateral procedures, particularly in emotional and physical domains. Post-surgical anxiety significantly improved. However, male survivors reported higher levels of depression and reduced motivation. Employment status emerged as a significant factor influencing physical functioning scores. Thyroid cancer patients demonstrated better social functioning than peers with other cancers, yet they lagged behind healthy controls. Long-term follow-up highlighted ongoing challenges in physical functioning and fatigue. Conclusions: Thyroid surgery impacts multiple dimensions of QoL in pediatric patients, with variations depending on surgical approach and patient characteristics. These findings underscore the need for comprehensive post-operative care, including routine QoL assessments and tailored psychological support. Future research should aim to standardize assessment timing and develop targeted interventions for high-risk groups.",Thyroid Disorders
40722438,Evaluation of Mandibular Bone Alterations by Panoramic Radiography: A Potential Tool in the Identification of Signs of Osteopenia and Osteoporosis.,"This study aimed to evaluate the validity of panoramic radiography as an auxiliary method for identifying mandibular bone features consistent with a diagnosis of osteopenia or osteoporosis. Ninety panoramic radiographs were analyzed to assess the quality of the mandibular cortical layer below the mental foramen on both sides of the mandible. Scores C1 (normal), C2 (osteopenia), and C3 (osteoporosis) were attributed according to the cortical morphology. The sample consisted of 78 (86%) women aged 45 years or older and 12 (14%) men older than 60 years old. In 39 (43%) cases, the C1 score was evidenced as the lower mandibular cortical layer was normal on the image. The C2 score was identified in 47 (52%) cases, in which the cortical layer showed semilunar defects. Four (5%) cases presented a C3 score, with the cortical layer showing a clearly porous, thinner bone cortex. The presence of risk behaviors (e.g., smoking and alcoholism) as well as some comorbidities (e.g., systemic arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus and thyroid disorders) was also observed.

40715434,Drug related problems and associated factors among thyroid disorder patients in Northwest Ethiopia.,"Thyroid disorder patients are likely to have a prescription for various categories of drugs including those with a narrow therapeutic index and others, which affects thyroid function. However, information regarding drug therapy problems in thyroid patients has not been studied here yet. Thus this study aimed to assess drug therapy problems and associated factors among thyroid disorder patients, who had follow-ups at Northwest Hospitals of Ethiopia. A multicenter hospital-based cross-sectional study design was employed through patient interviews and chart review at public hospitals in Northwest Ethiopia. A simple random sampling technique was used to recruit patients for interviews. The identified drug-related problem was recorded and classified using Cipolle et al. 2012, adverse drug reactions were assessed by using the Naranjo algorithm of adverse drug reaction probability scale, and Up-to-date was used for the drug-drug interaction checker. The collected data was cleared, entered into epidata, checked for correctness, and exported to STATA version 17 for analysis. The results were summarized using descriptive statistics including frequency, mean, median, and standard deviation. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the independent predictors of drug therapy problems. A P-value < 0.05 is considered statistically significant. Among 351 study participants most of them 300 (85.47%) were females. The study participants' mean (± SD) age was 45.1± (0.74) years. At least one drug-related problem was recorded from 60.11%, (95% CI: 54.9-65.13) of study participants with a mean of 1.54 ± 0.046 drug-related problems per patient. The most common drug-related problems were non-adherence (34.47%) followed by adverse drug reactions (17.2%) and ineffective drug therapy (8.2%). Factors independently associated with drug-related problems were age [AOR = 2.85, 95%CI: (1.05-7.69), P-value = 0.039], poly-pharmacy [AOR = 2.57, 95%CI: (1.01-6.29), P-value = 0.046], comorbidity [AOR = 2.09, 95%CI: (1.07-4.05), P-value = 0.030], and purchasing medication from private pharmacy [AOR = 2.62, 95%CI: (1.06-6.49), P-value = 0.038]. The prevalence of drug-related problems among adult thyroid disease patients who had follow up at ambulatory clinics was very high. Age, poly-pharmacy, comorbidity, and purchasing medication in private pharmacies were independent predictors of drug-related problems. The most commonly involved medication class in experiencing drug-related problems was thionamides.",Thyroid Disorders

This study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated factors of these conditions among pregnant women in India. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 300 pregnant women attending antenatal clinics at a tertiary care hospital. The participants were enrolled irrespective of gestational age. Known cases of pre-existing hypertension, diabetes, and thyroid disorders were excluded. Data were collected via structured questionnaires and clinical records, capturing demographics, obstetric history, lifestyle, diagnostic values, and the awareness of risk factors. Conditions were diagnosed based on standardized criteria (Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Group India {DIPSI} for GDM, blood pressure {BP} of ≥140/90 mmHg for hypertension, and trimester-specific thyroid-stimulating hormone {TSH} levels for thyroid dysfunction). Results The prevalence of GDM, hypertension, and thyroid dysfunction was 60 (20%), 48 (16%), and 36 (12%), respectively. GDM and hypertension were significantly more common in urban participants (p<0.05), and both were associated with higher body mass index (BMI). Thyroid dysfunction was frequently diagnosed in the first trimester (22, 61.1%). A significant upward trend in all three disorders was observed with increasing BMI. The awareness of risk factors was higher among educated women, correlating with earlier diagnosis. Conclusion This study highlights a substantial burden of NCDs among pregnant women, especially GDM and hypertension. Urbanization, obesity, and maternal age were key contributing factors. While structured screening and early antenatal registration are existing mandates, our findings underscore the need for targeted and scalable interventions beyond current protocols.",Thyroid Disorders
40688911,Prevalence and Risk Factors of Subclinical and Overt Hypothyroidism in Saudi Arabia: A Systematic Review.,"Hypothyroidism, whether subclinical (SCH) or overt (OH), stands among the most common yet often overlooked endocrine disorders, with its prevalence varying widely across different populations. In Saudi Arabia, factors such as metabolic comorbidities, genetic predisposition, and regional disparities contribute to its epidemiology. This systematic review aimed to summarize the existing literature on the prevalence and risk factors of SCH and OH in Saudi Arabia to lead clinical practice and public health strategies. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify relevant studies published in the past decade. Studies meeting predefined inclusion criteria were selected, and data on study characteristics, prevalence, risk factors, and diagnostic methods were extracted. Methodological quality was assessed using a standardized appraisal tool. Due to heterogeneity, a narrative synthesis was performed. Reported prevalence rates varied across populations, with higher rates observed in certain groups such as pregnant women and individuals with specific comorbidities. Female gender, advanced age, family history, and chronic conditions were associated risk factors. Broader screening approaches in pregnancy appeared to identify more SCH cases than selective strategies. Regional differences in prevalence within Saudi Arabia were also noted. Most included studies demonstrated low to moderate risk of bias. The burden of hypothyroidism in Saudi Arabia varies by population and region, with distinct risk factors underscoring the need for tailored screening and management. Expanded screening in high-risk groups and further research on causal pathways are recommended to address this growing health concern.",Thyroid Disorders

Nonetheless, it remains uncertain whether there is a genetic causal relationship between AITD and CeD, while the beneficial effects on a GFD are controversial. This study aim to explore the causal relationship between CeD and AITD, particularly with HT, and to determine whether a GFD is beneficial for AITD. We performed a two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis on data from the largest meta-analysis summary statistics of AITD, CeD and GFD. Genetic instrumental variables were established by pinpointing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that relate to corresponding factors. In assessing sensitivity and heterogeneity, we conducted examinations of MR Egger, weighted median, simple mode, weighted mode, and MR Egger intercept tests. HT was found to play a pathogenic role in increasing the risk of CeD (ORIVW = 1.544 [95%CI 1.153-2.068], p = 0.00355), and our Mendelian randomization study does not support genetic liability related to CeD with GD (Graves' disease) and GFD with AITD. This study supports the positive correlation between HT risk and CeD risk, while GFD has no protective effect on AITD and may exert its effect through other mechanisms. These findings provide valuable insights into potential targets for disease intervention and treatment at the genetic level.",Thyroid Disorders
40668138,Machine Learning-Based Screening of Cosmetic Ingredients Identifies Vat Blue 6 as a Thyroid Hormone Receptor β Disruptor.,"Thyroid disorders are among the most prevalent endocrine conditions worldwide, exhibiting a rising incidence and disproportionately affecting women. In this study, we hypothesized that cosmetics may contain previously unidentified thyroid-disrupting chemicals. To evaluate this possibility, we compiled a comprehensive data set of cosmetic ingredients and developed a random forest regression-based machine learning model to predict their potential to disrupt thyroid hormone receptor β (TRβ), a critical regulator of thyroid function. From the top 40 compounds ranked by the model, 12 frequently used cosmetic ingredients were selected for experimental validation. Of these, six demonstrated measurable binding affinity toward TRβ. Notably, Vat Blue 6 (VB6), a colorant utilized in cosmetic formulations, exhibited structural characteristics potentially mimicking thyroid hormones and displayed potent TRβ binding with an affinity (Kd) as low as 0.7 μM. Subsequent in vitro assays and in vivo experiments in mice confirmed VB6's thyroid-disrupting effects, evidenced by dose-dependent reductions in serum thyroid hormone concentrations and morphological alterations of thyroid tissue. This study highlights the efficacy of machine learning approaches in rapidly screening large chemical inventories to identify potential thyroid disruptors and underscores the critical need for further toxicological assessment of cosmetic ingredients, particularly considering their frequent and prolonged exposure among female populations.",Thyroid Disorders

40661783,"Prolonged Exposure to Elevated Iodine Levels in Drinking Water Is Associated With the Occurrence of Autoimmune Thyroid Disorders in Adults: Findings From a Case-Control Study Conducted in Shandong Province, China.","Background: Excessive iodine intake is associated with an increased risk of thyroid autoimmunity. However, the relationship between prolonged exposure to iodine levels exceeding 100 μg/L in drinking water and the occurrence of autoimmune thyroid disorders (AITDs) remains uncertain. The objective of the present study was to assess whether elevated iodine levels exceeding 100 μg/L in drinking water are a risk factor for AITD. Methods: We conducted a case-control study at a hospital, enrolling 668 adults. We measured serum thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb), thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb), urinary iodine concentration (UIC), water iodine concentration (WIC), and serum cytokine concentrations-including interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Results: The study demonstrated that individuals with water iodine levels > 100 μg/L had a significantly higher risk of developing AITD compared with those in the 10-100 μg/L group (OR = 2.076, p < 0.001). Furthermore, a family history of thyroid disorders (OR = 4.035, p < 0.001) and higher education levels (specifically college education compared to primary school; OR = 2.608, p=0.016) were associated with an increased risk of AITD. Conversely, regular consumption of freshwater fish was correlated with a lower risk of developing AITD (at least once per week vs. hardly eat, OR = 0.472, p=0.009; at least once per month vs. hardly eat, OR = 0.693, p=0.042). Additionally, IL-6 levels in the case group were significantly higher than those in the control group. Conclusions: The case-control study demonstrated a significant association between the development of AITD and prolonged exposure to elevated iodine levels (above 100 μg/L) in water. AITD was found to be associated with several other factors. Risk factors for AITD include a family history of thyroid disorders and higher educational attainment. Additionally, the consumption of freshwater fish was identified as a protective factor. Identifying and understanding these significant risk and protective factors for AITD development are critical, and effective strategies should be developed and implemented for prevention and intervention targeting at-risk individuals.",Thyroid Disorders

While current endocrinology guidelines define distinct thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) target values for women undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART), the optimal preconception TSH range for in vitro fertilization (IVF) success remains a topic of debate. Objectives: This study aimed to assess the impact of baseline TSH levels within the recommended normal range on IVF outcomes, specifically clinical pregnancy and live birth rates. Additionally, we assessed the predictive value of procedural and preprocedural factors, including maternal body mass index (BMI) and TSH, using machine learning models. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, single-center cohort study at the Institute of Reproductive Medicine, University of Szeged, involving 996 women who underwent IVF, with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Biometric, medical history, laboratory, and procedural factors were analyzed. Pregnancy and live birth predictions were modeled using support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithms. The significance of features in the RF and XGBoost models was assessed. Results: SVM models achieved a mean accuracy of 72.26% in predicting pregnancy but were less effective for live birth classification. RF and XGBoost models demonstrated an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.76 and 0.74 for pregnancy and 0.67 and 0.61, respectively, for live birth. Key predictors included embryo score, maternal age, BMI, and specific hormone levels. Notably, male factors also contributed to outcome prediction. Analysis suggested that variations in maternal TSH within the normal range (0.3-4.0 mIU/L) had no significant impact on IVF success. Conclusions: Our study suggests that preconception TSH levels within the reference range do not significantly influence IVF success, which indirectly supports the validity of the current recommendations on this matter. While machine learning models demonstrated promising predictive performance, larger prospective studies are needed to refine thyroid function targets in ART, with a separate analysis of women with thyroid autoimmunity.",Thyroid Disorders
40647196,Sexual Functioning and Depressive Symptoms in Levothyroxine-Treated Women with Postpartum Thyroiditis and Different Vitamin D Status.,"Background/Objectives: Hypothyroidism and thyroid autoimmunity have a negative effect on women's sexual health, which is only partially reversed by thyroid hormone substitution. Sexual functioning in thyroid disorders after delivery has been poorly researched. The aim of our study was to compare the effect of levothyroxine on sexual response and depressive symptoms in women with postpartum thyroiditis (PPT) and different vitamin D status. Methods: The study population consisted of three matched groups of women with the hypothyroid phase of PPT: two groups with subclinical and one with overt thyroid hypofunction. Each group included similar numbers of women with normal and low vitamin D status. For the following six months, one group of women with subclinical hypothyroidism and all women with overt thyroid hypofunction received levothyroxine. At the beginning and at the end of the study, all participants completed questionnaires evaluating female sexual function (FSFI) and depressive symptoms (BMI-II). The remaining outcomes of interest included thyroid antibody titers, and the serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, TSH, free thyroid hormones, sex hormones, and prolactin. Results: Before levothyroxine substitution, women with overt and subclinical disease differed in the total FSFI score, all domain scores, and the overall BDI-II score. Within each study group, domain scores for desire were greater in women with vitamin D sufficiency than in those with vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency. Testosterone and estradiol levels were lower in women with overt than in women with subclinical hypothyroidism, while the opposite relationship was found for prolactin. Levothyroxine treatment improved all domains of female sexual function and reduced the total BDI-II score in both patients with overt and subclinical hypothyroidism and normal vitamin D status. In women with vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency, the impact of this agent was limited to arousal, lubrication, and sexual satisfaction. Levothyroxine replacement reduced thyroid antibody titers only in women with normal vitamin D status. The impact on testosterone was limited to women with normal vitamin D status, and was more pronounced in women with overt than subclinical disease. The effect on estradiol and prolactin, observed only in overt disease, was unrelated to vitamin D status. The increase in sexual functioning correlated with the following: 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (in vitamin D-deficient/insufficient women); the impact on thyroid peroxidase antibodies, free triiodothyronine and testosterone (for desire and arousal); and the changes in the overall BDI-II score. Five years later, the quality of life was better in vitamin D-sufficient women receiving levothyroxine in the postpartum period. Conclusions: Low vitamin D status attenuates the impact of levothyroxine on female sexual function and depressive symptoms in women with the hypothyroid phase of PPT.",Thyroid Disorders
40647159,Lifestyle Interventions to Tackle Cardiovascular Risk in Thyroid Hormone Signaling Disorders.,"Thyroid hormones (THs) play a central role in cardiovascular and metabolic regulation, influencing lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity and resting energy expenditure. Inherited disorders of impaired sensitivity to THs-including resistance to thyroid hormone alpha (RTHα) and beta (RTHβ), monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) deficiency and selenoprotein deficiency-lead to complex, multisystemic clinical features. Although these conditions are rare, with RTHβ being the most common and affecting about 1 in 20,000 newborns, they share clinical features with more prevalent thyroid disorders, such as hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, as well as neurological manifestations including muscle wasting and spasticity. These conditions present abnormal patterns of thyroid function and are associated with tissue-specific comorbidities such as arrhythmias, heart failure, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome. To date, no targeted or controlled studies have evaluated the impact of lifestyle modifications in these patient populations. Therefore, this narrative review proposes plausible management strategies based on pathophysiological insights into the effects of thyroid hormones on target organs, combined with clinical reasoning and evidence extrapolated from related disorders. Physical exercise and diet may complement pharmacological treatments (e.g., levothyroxine or TRIAC) to improve cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes. In RTHβ, aerobic exercise enhances cardiovascular health, while a Mediterranean diet supports lipid control and glycemic parameters. In RTHα, physical exercise may aid neuromotor development, and a fluid-rich, fiber-moderated diet can alleviate constipation. In MCT8 deficiency, physiotherapy may improve mobility and relieve contractures, while nutritional support (e.g., feeding tube, gastrostomy) can be necessary to tackle feeding difficulties and reduce pulmonary complications. In selenoprotein deficiency, low-to-moderate physical exercise and an antioxidant-rich diet may protect against oxidative stress at several tissue levels. Although quantitative evidence is limited, this narrative review synthesizes current insights, providing a meaningful basis for future validation and research.",Thyroid Disorders
40621769,Iodine and Hypothyroidism.,"Hypothyroidism is a thyroid disorder disease caused by a decrease in the synthesis or secretion of thyroid hormones and is one of the most common thyroid disorders in clinical practice. Elemental iodine is consumed daily in salt and food, such as seaweed. Iodine deficiency is the most common cause of thyroid disorders. Iodine is oxidized in the body to produce iodine-containing thyroid hormones. Iodine deficiency can lead to goitre deficencyand can also affect children and infants, leading to mental retardation and developmental delays. The causes of hypothyroidism are complex and can be divided into autoimmune hypothyroidism, post-thyroid surgery hypothyroidism, drug-induced hypothyroidism, post-131I therapy hypothyroidism, post-surgical pituitary or hypothalamic tumor hypothyroidism and congenital hypothyroidism. Among them, autoimmune hypothyroidism, post-thyroid surgery hypothyroidism and pharmacological hypothyroidism account for 90% of the hypothyroidism causes. Serum iodine content is very closely related to them,.and in post-surgical hypothyroid diseases, iodine can also be used as a supplement to reduce the incidence of post-surgical diseases, and there exists a complementary role in the recovery of the disease. Iodine has a complementary role in the occurrence and treatment of thyroid diseases. Thus, this paper explores and summarizes the correlation between iodine and hypothyroidism around the two parts of iodine and hypothyroidism, aiming to provide a reference for daily life, clinical research and basic investigation.",Thyroid Disorders

40621269,Effect of Autologous Platelet-Rich Plasma on Thyroidectomy Scars: A Prospective Interventional Study in a Tertiary Care Hospital in India.,"Introduction Thyroid disorders are highly prevalent in India, and thyroidectomy is a frequently performed surgical procedure to manage these conditions. While conventional thyroidectomy is effective, it often results in visible neck scars, leading to patient dissatisfaction and psychosocial concerns. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP), rich in growth factors and adhesion molecules, has shown promise in enhancing wound healing and modulating scar formation. However, its efficacy in improving thyroidectomy scars remains underexplored, particularly in the Indian context. Methods A prospective, randomized, interventional study was conducted over 18 months (April 2023- October 2024) at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Vardhman Mahavir Medical College and Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi. Thirty-two patients (aged 18-50 years) undergoing conventional thyroidectomy were randomized into two groups: Group A (control, n = 16) received standard subcuticular sutures, while Group B (intervention, n = 16) received intraoperative autologous PRP injections prior to closure. PRP was prepared by centrifuging 10 mL of the patient's blood at 2500 rpm for 10 minutes. Scar assessment was performed at 4 months postoperatively using the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) by blinded evaluators. Results Baseline characteristics, including age, sex distribution, diagnosis, and type of thyroidectomy, were comparable between groups. Patient-reported outcomes indicated significantly less scar pain (mean score: 1.06 vs. 1.75; p = 0.002), reduced pigmentation difference (1.81 vs. 2.31; p = 0.032), and decreased scar thickness (1.75 vs. 2.12; p = 0.033) in the PRP group. The total POSAS patient score was significantly lower in Group B (8.81 vs. 10.56; p = 0.012), reflecting better subjective scar perception. Observer assessments corroborated these findings, noting reduced vascularity (1.06 vs. 2.31; p = 0.001), improved pigmentation (1.81 vs. 2.43; p = 0.031), and enhanced pliability (1.43 vs. 1.87; p = 0.021) in the PRP group. The total POSAS observer score favored Group B (9.12 vs. 12.18; p = 0.003). Conclusion Intraoperative application of autologous PRP significantly enhances scar quality following thyroidectomy, as evidenced by both patient and observer assessments. PRP offers a cost-effective, safe, and autologous approach to improve postoperative cosmetic outcomes, particularly beneficial in resource-limited settings. Further studies with larger cohorts and extended follow-up are warranted to validate these findings and establish standardized protocols for PRP application in thyroid surgery.",Thyroid Disorders
40615107,Exploring thyroid development and function: A systems biology search for new chemical disruptor targets.,"Indiscriminate exposure to chemical substances has emerged as a critical global health concern. Human exposure to emerging contaminants, including pharmaceutical residues, pesticides, food additives, and chemicals employed in packaging and bottle production, is associated with an increased incidence of diseases, including thyroid disorders. Several chemicals potentially dysregulate thyroid embryonic development and the adult hypothalamic‒pituitary‒thyroid (HPT) axis. In this study, we applied systems biology approaches to identify biological processes associated with the most highly upregulated and downregulated genes in human thyroid transcriptome data from both the embryonic and adult stages. As a result, new gene/protein‒chemical interactions linked to recognized toxicities in the thyroid gland and the HPT axis were identified. This analysis identified 195 distinct chemical substances that may interact with these highly expressed proteins and exhibit thyroid toxicity. Our findings underscore the developmental period as a critical window of vulnerability to chemical exposure, with potential adverse effects on thyroid development and programming. Finally, our data suggest new targets for emerging chemicals in the thyroids of adult individuals, potentially compromising thyroid function.",Thyroid Disorders

40605880,De Novo Graves' Disease in a 10-Year-Old Girl Receiving Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Agonist Therapy for Idiopathic Central Precocious Puberty: A Case Report.,"We present a case of Graves' disease in a 10-year-old girl with a family history of thyroid disease, which may represent a significant risk factor. The patient developed this condition while receiving gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist therapy for idiopathic central precocious puberty. The patient presented with headache and vomiting during leuprorelin acetate treatment. Thyroid function tests revealed suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels accompanied by elevated free triiodothyronine (FT3) and free thyroxine (FT4) concentrations and positive TSH receptor antibodies (TRAb). Thyroid ultrasonography demonstrated diffuse glandular enlargement with increased vascularity, consistent with Graves' disease. Subsequently, GnRH agonist therapy was discontinued, and thiamazole treatment resulted in normalized thyroid function. Given the rarity of Graves' disease in the pediatric population, this case suggests a potential contributory role of GnRH agonist therapy in its onset. Current evidence suggests that GnRH agonists precipitate autoimmune thyroid disorders predominantly through two pathways: (i) a sustained hypoestrogenism-driven immune rebound state and (ii) direct GnRH-mediated lymphocyte activation. These mechanisms, combined with our patient's family history, highlight the potential importance of thyroid function monitoring in children receiving long-term GnRH agonist therapy, particularly those with a similar genetic predisposition.",Thyroid Disorders

40584044,Viral infection and thyroid disorders: a narrative review.,"Thyroid disorders, including thyroid dysfunction, autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITDs), and thyroid cancers (TCs), are receiving increasing attention as significant public health concerns. Viral infection can interfere with normal immune function by activating innate and adaptive immunity, causing endocrine disorders. As an important endocrine gland, thyroid function is easily affected by viral infection, inducing the formation of autoantigens by mimicking thyroid components, thereby promoting the development of AITDs. Viruses like herpes simplex virus (HSV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human parvovirus B19 (B19V) are potential candidates associated with AITDs. These viral infections also play a key role in tumor pathogenesis, where chronic infection or reactivation of viruses can change the immune microenvironment in the body and promote the occurrence and development of cancer. Numerous studies have confirmed the associations between various viruses, such as B19V, EBV, HSV, and HCV, with TCs. This review examines the impacts of viral infections on thyroid function and the underlying mechanisms involved, and also analyzes the common characteristics and mechanisms of viral infection-induced TCs. By analyzing the existing research hypotheses, we summarized the possible mechanisms of viral infection-induced thyroid disorders and also identified the potential role of viral infection in the process of anaplastic transformation of TC. This information provides insights into the model of multistage carcinogenesis of TCs, especially the mechanism of the transition from differentiated to undifferentiated or anaplastic TCs.",Thyroid Disorders
40580633,"2, 2', 4, 4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether induces thyroid toxicity by targeting BRAF-mediated MEK-ERK-NIS pathway in human thyroid follicular epithelial cells.","2, 2', 4, 4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), one of the most abundant and toxic congeners of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), has been implicated in thyroid disorders, but its thyroid toxicity in human thyroid cells and underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Given the pivotal role of the V-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) and the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)- signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway in cell proliferation, differentiation, cell cycle and thyroid functions, in this study, we constructed BRAF knockout (BRAF-KO) and overexpression (BRAF-OE) cell models using Nthy-ori 3-1 cells, to evaluate the effect of BDE-47 on human thyroid cells and explore the potential mechanisms. Our results showed that exposure to BDE-47 resulted in reduced cell viability, Gap 2 (G2)/mitosis (M) phase cell cycle arrest, enhanced cell migration, and decreased cell invasion. BRAF overexpression significantly exacerbated BDE-47-triggered cell cycle arrest and cell migration but alleviated its suppression of invasion, while BRAF knockout showed no significant effects, underscoring the crucial role of BRAF in BDE-47-induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, BRAF overexpression amplified BDE-47-triggered upregulation of phosphorylated MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 downregulation of sodium-iodide symporter (NIS), a well-known indicator of cellular iodine uptake. Molecular docking further indicated that BDE-47 likely activated the MEK-ERK- NIS signal cascade by directly binding to BRAF. This study demonstrated for the first time that BDE-47 led to reduced cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest, altered migration and invasion, and impaired iodine uptake through targeted activation of the BRAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway. These findings elucidated a novel mechanism of BDE-47-induced thyroid toxicity, highlighting BRAF as a critical mediator for PBDEs-related thyroid dysfunction, offering insights for targeted interventions.",Thyroid Disorders

40572664,Exploring the Prevalence of Dry Eye Disease and Its Impact on Quality of Life in Saudi Adults: A Cross-Sectional Investigation.,"Background and Objectives: Dry eye disease (DED) is a multifactorial condition that affects quality of life (QoL). Symptoms like discomfort, blurred vision, and light sensitivity can negatively impact work efficiency, productivity, and psychological well-being. This study aimed to examine the relationship between DED and QoL, identify risk factors, and estimate DED prevalence in Saudi Arabia. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study included 1062 participants from Saudi Arabia, recruited via convenience sampling. Data were collected using an online questionnaire with three sections: sociodemographic information, the ocular surface disease index (OSDI) to assess DED severity, and the Arabic WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire to evaluate QoL. Results: Among participants, 77% suffered from DED. Males (β = -9.18, p < 0.001), postgraduate degree holders (β = -13.86, p = 0.001), and individuals with income >15,000 SR (β = -5.10, p = 0.023) had lower OSDI scores compared to reference groups (females, those with high school education or lower, and those with income <5000 SR, respectively), indicating a lower DED risk. Employed individuals, students (employed: β = 10.78, p < 0.020; students: β = 10.60, p < 0.016), divorced/widowed individuals (β = 18.70, p < 0.003), and those with diabetes, hypertension, and thyroid disorders showed higher OSDI scores. Higher OSDI scores correlated with lower QoL scores across all domains (physical: β = -0.26, p < 0.001; psychological: β = -0.22, p < 0.001; social: β = -0.25, p < 0.001; environmental: β = -0.20, p < 0.001). Conclusions: DED significantly affects all QoL domains. Risk factors include occupation, diabetes, hypertension, and thyroid disorders. Awareness and prevention efforts should be prioritized by institutions, while physicians should screen for DED in patients with chronic conditions. Further research is needed on the long-term effects of these risk factors and to improve management strategies.",Thyroid Disorders

40557834,Development of Graves' disease in a patient with lymphocytic hypophysitis following glucocorticoid treatment.,"We report the case of a 41-year-old Japanese woman with visual field disturbances during late pregnancy. At 39 weeks of gestation, she was diagnosed with bitemporal hemianopsia at the ophthalmology department. An MRI revealed a symmetrical pituitary gland enlargement, compressing the optic chiasm. An emergency cesarean section was performed immediately, resulting in the delivery of a male infant weighing 3,112 grams. Laboratory tests indicated low serum free thyroxine (T4), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), cortisol, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone. The patient was clinically diagnosed with lymphocytic hypophysitis (LHy). Due to her visual field impairment, she was administered 60 mg of prednisolone daily. After 2 days, her visual field impairment improved rapidly, leading to a gradual tapering of the dose. Six months after treatment initiation, an MRI showed shrinkage of the pituitary gland. Her prednisolone dose was reduced to 5 mg daily, and she was switched to hydrocortisone at 15 mg daily. Twelve months after starting treatment, the patient developed thyrotoxicosis. Testing revealed a positive TSH receptor antibody, resulting in a diagnosis of Graves' disease (GD). Treatment with thiamazole (15 mg daily) and potassium iodide (76 mg daily) was initiated, and her thyroid function normalized after 2 months. LHy is believed to have an autoimmune mechanism and is frequently associated with other autoimmune diseases; however, the development of GD is rare. Development of Graves' disease should be considered in patients with LHy, particularly during the postpartum period and the glucocorticoid treatment process.",Thyroid Disorders
40555109,Comparison of 2D:4D digit ratios in patients with Hashimoto's and Graves' diseases: A systematic review.,"This systematic review includes three descriptive studies that investigated the relationship between biological markers such as the 2D:4D digit ratio and morphological femininity and thyroid diseases. Two of the studies involved only female participants, while one included both males and females. Participants ranged in age from 20 to 80, and all studies applied inclusion criteria such as being of the same ethnic origin and having no history of hand or finger injuries. The studies suggest that autoimmune thyroid disorders like Hashimotos thyroiditis and Graves' disease may be associated with prenatal exposure to sex hormones. A higher 2D:4D ratio is considered indicative of greater prenatal estrogen exposure, whereas a lower ratio reflects higher testosterone exposure. Individuals with Hashimoto's thyroiditis were found to have significantly higher 2D:4D ratios compared to healthy controls, while those with Graves' disease had lower ratios. Differences in the right-hand 2D:4D ratio were more pronounced than those in the left hand. One study also found a positive correlation between morphological femininity and the severity of Hashimoto's disease, as measured by TPOAb levels. These findings indicate that hormonal influences during prenatal and adolescent periods may have lasting effects on the immune system and thyroid function. However, all studies included in this review are descriptive in nature, and thus, the results are correlational rather than causal. Further prospective studies and systematic reviews are needed to better understand these associations.",Thyroid Disorders

40551544,Risk of breast cancer among women with hypo- and hyperthyroidism: Results from a large nationwide cohort study.,"Experimental evidence links thyroid hormones to breast cancer cell proliferation, but the association between thyroid disorders and breast cancer remains unclear, with previous research yielding conflicting results. This large cohort study investigated the association between hypo- and hyperthyroidism and breast cancer among all women born in Denmark between January 1, 1960, and December 31, 1997 (n = 1,058,939). Data on hypo- and hyperthyroidism diagnoses, cancer diagnoses, covariates, migration, and vital status were obtained from Danish national registers. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for breast cancer overall and for histological subtypes were calculated based on adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression models. A total of 49,015 women developed hypothyroidism, 26,950 developed hyperthyroidism, and 15,703 were diagnosed with breast cancer during a median follow-up of 18.8 years. Hypothyroidism was associated with a decreased rate of breast cancer (HR: 0.85, 95% CI 0.78-0.93), with a possible stronger association among postmenopausal women (HR: 0.78, 95% CI 0.68-0.90). In contrast, hyperthyroidism showed no association with breast cancer (HR: 1.00, 95% CI 0.89-1.11), and menopausal status did not affect this association. All findings were consistent across time since first thyroid disease diagnosis and histological subtypes. In conclusion, our study suggests that hypothyroidism is associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer, potentially most pronounced among postmenopausal women, while no association was observed between hyperthyroidism and breast cancer risk. These findings highlight the need for further research to understand the biological mechanisms linking thyroid dysfunction and breast cancer, especially in the context of menopausal status.",Thyroid Disorders

40537957,Insights Into the Pathophysiology of Superior Limbic Keratoconjunctivitis in Chronic Ocular Graft-Versus-Host Disease.,"Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis (SLK) is a chronic inflammatory ocular surface disorder affecting the superior conjunctiva and limbus. Its pathogenesis entails a vicious cycle of microtrauma and inflammation. Besides its well-known association with thyroid disorders, SLK has also been associated with systemic conditions involving severe ocular surface disease. One condition that can secondarily develop SLK is ocular graft-versus-host disease (oGVHD). Ocular graft-versus-host disease, a complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, is a pan-ocular surface disease that can lead to severe ocular complications and vision loss. Importantly, the occurrence of SLK in the setting of oGVHD is a marker of an augmented ocular surface distress that requires immediate aggressive management to prevent irreversible ocular surface damage, notably limbal stem-cell deficiency. Treatment of SLK in oGVHD includes aggressive lubrication, anti-inflammatory drops, serum/plasma drops, and large diameter contact lenses. In particular, scleral contact lenses are currently the most effective long-term treatment for SLK in oGVHD and can significantly reduce the risk of irreversible loss of vision. Of note, conjunctival resection or destruction (e.g., cauterization) is not recommended for treatment of SLK in ocular graft-versus-host disease. This review examines the pathophysiology and treatment modalities for SLK in oGVHD aimed at improving long-term outcomes.",Thyroid Disorders
40531844,"Comprehensive framework for thyroid disorder diagnosis: Integrating advanced feature selection, genetic algorithms, and machine learning for enhanced accuracy and other performance matrices.","Thyroid hormones control crucial physiological activities, such as metabolism, oxidative stress, erythropoiesis, thermoregulation, and organ development. Hormonal imbalances may cause serious conditions like cognitive impairment, depression, and nervous system damage. Traditional diagnostic techniques, based on hormone level measurements (TSH, T3, FT4, T4, and FTI), are usually lengthy and laborious. This study uses machine learning (ML) algorithms and feature selection based on GA to improve the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosing thyroid disorders using the UCI thyroid dataset. Five ML algorithms-LR, RF, SVM, AB, and DT- were tested using two paradigms: (1) default classifiers and (2) hybrid GA-ML models- GA-RF, GA-LR, GA-SVM, GA-DT, and GA-AB. The data pre-processed included handling missing values, feature scaling, and correlation analysis. In this case, the performance metrics used for model evaluation are accuracy, F1 Score, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and Cohen's Kappa with 80% of the dataset to train the model and the rest 20% used to test it. Among the non-hybrid models, RF achieved the highest accuracy, which was 93.93%. The hybrid GA-RF model outperformed all others, achieving a remarkable accuracy of 97.21%, along with superior metrics across all the evaluated parameters. These findings highlight the diagnostic potential of the GA-RF model in providing faster, more accurate, and reliable thyroid disorder detection. The research illustrated the potential of the hybrid GA-ML approaches to improving the clinical diagnostic process while proposing a strong and scalable approach towards thyroid disorder identification.",Thyroid Disorders

40527749,Ultrasensitive Quantification of Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone and Thyroxine by Nanoelectronic SnS2 Transistor Sensors.,"The measurement of thyroid hormones in serum is widely regarded as the most valuable single laboratory tool for assessing thyroid function. This study presents a highly sensitive tin disulfide nanosheet-fabricated field-effect transistor (SnS2-FET) designed for the detections of human thyroid-stimulating hormone (hTSH) and thyroxine (T4). By co-modifying an antibody (AbTSH for detecting hTSH), or a DNA aptamer (AptT4 for detecting T4), with polyethylene glycol (PEG) on the SnS2-FET channel surface, the PEG:AbTSH/SnS2-FET and PEG:AptT4/SnS2-FET devices achieve highly sensitive and selective detections of hTSH and T4, respectively, even in a high ionic strength buffer (1× PBS) or undiluted serum. With a low limit of detection (in the femtomolar level) and a wide linear working range (spanning at least 6 orders of magnitude of analyte concentration), the PEG:AbTSH/SnS2-FET immunosensor and PEG:AptT4/SnS2-FET aptasensor can detect the hTSH and T4 levels encountered in the spectrum of thyroid disorders. Notably, these specific receptor-modified SnS2-FET devices display negligible cross-reactivity with other pituitary hormones or serum components. This research indicates that the nanoelectronic SnS2-FET sensor platforms hold significant potential for point-of-care clinical diagnostics, particularly for the ultrasensitive detection and early screening of medical conditions.",Thyroid Disorders

We explored the agreement and comparative validity (concurrent and predictive) of 20 CC prevalence indicators independently constructed using the French National Health Data System (SNDS) and Health, Health Care, and Insurance Survey (ESPS 2010-2014). Individual data from 5039 ESPS participants aged ≥25 years, representative of the 2010 French general population, were linked to the SNDS. Follow-up data included a 2014 health self-assessment and 5-year mortality. We considered 20 CCs with corresponding SNDS case-identifying algorithms and self-reported information from ESPS, including most cardiovascular diseases and frequent cancers. Kappa statistics assessed agreement between CC indicators across databases. Polytomous and dichotomous logistic regression assessed determinants of disagreement between sources and associations of indicators with health outcomes (concurrent and predictive validity). Prevalence values were much higher with survey data except for hypertension, diabetes, thyroid disorders, epilepsy, and most cancers for which they were closer (±20%) to claims data. Agreement between CC indicators varied from the strongest (hypertension, diabetes, thyroid disorders, most cancers) to the weakest (cardiac rhythm disorders, peptic ulcer, chronic liver diseases). Sex, age, and multimorbidity strongly influenced agreement. Most claims database indicators were more strongly associated with health outcomes. Health interview surveys and healthcare claims-derived indicators are not interchangeable given their specific determinants. Since no general rule applies to all CCs, the advantages and disadvantages of each data source should be closely considered in case-to-case analysis.",Thyroid Disorders

This study employs a two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) approach to assess the causal relationship between long-term PM2.5 exposure and thyroid disorders. Genetic instruments for PM2.5 exposure were sourced from the UK Biobank, while outcome data on thyroid dysfunction and its subtypes were obtained from the FinnGen consortium. The primary method was inverse-variance weighted (IVW), supplemented by MR-Egger, weighted median, simple mode and weighted mode analyses. Pleiotropy and heterogeneity were evaluated with MR-Egger intercept, MR-PRESSO, and Cochran's Q test. The IVW method revealed a significant 77% increased risk of thyroid disorders per standard deviation rise in PM2.5 exposure (OR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.29-2.43, p = 3.93 × 10-4). Notably, a strong causal association was identified with autoimmune hypothyroidism (OR = 1.83, 95% CI: 1.26-2.64, p = 1.33 × 10-3), but not with autoimmune hyperthyroidism or other subtypes. Sensitivity analyses showed no pleiotropy or heterogeneity.

40484893,"Pregnancy-associated thyroid disorders: the role of genetic, epigenetic, and oxidative stress factors.","Thyroid inflammation during pregnancy, particularly Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) and postpartum thyroiditis (PPT), has a strong genetic and epigenetic basis. Susceptibility to these conditions is associated with specific HLA haplotypes (HLA-DR3, DR4, DR5) and immune-regulatory genes, including CTLA-4, PTPN22, FOXP3, as well as thyroid-specific genes such as TSHR, TG, and TPO. CTLA-4 polymorphism (CT60) is linked to increased thyroid autoantibody production, while PTPN22 R620W variant disrupts immune tolerance, exacerbating autoreactive lymphocyte activation.Epigenetic modifications play a crucial role in HT and PPT pathogenesis. Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs), including miR-146a, miR-142, miR-301, and miR-155, affects immune pathways by modulating T-cell responses and inflammatory cytokine production. Aberrant DNA methylation in genes regulating immune function, such as FOXP3 and CTLA-4, contributes to altered immune tolerance and disease progression.Oxidative stress further modulates disease severity by inducing DNA damage and enhancing inflammatory responses, particularly in pregnancy. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) promote thyroid autoimmunity by affecting placental function and fetal neurodevelopment. Understanding the interplay between genetic susceptibility, epigenetic regulation, and oxidative stress is essential for developing personalized management strategies.

40467469,Neurological consequences of adult-onset hypothyroidism.,"Adult-onset hypothyroidism has long been recognized as a reversible cause of cognitive impairment. However, recent studies have shown that it is associated with structural brain alterations besides functional alterations, particularly in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Neurophysiological and molecular studies have demonstrated that hypothyroidism impairs synaptic plasticity, disrupts neurotransmitter signaling, and promotes neuroinflammation, leading to learning and memory impairments. The condition also affects adult neurogenesis, particularly in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Moreover, hypothyroidism has been linked to psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety, through its influence on the plasticity of the amygdala. In addition, adult-onset hypothyroidism contributes to cerebellar ataxia and peripheral neuropathy, impacting motor coordination and sensory processing. Since we come to know that adult-onset hypothyroidism in part causes irreversible changes in brain structure, prompt treatment is crucial. Furthermore, in addition to thyroid field, recent studies suggest a potential of thyroid hormone treatment beyond the thyroid disorders, such as neurodegenerative and cognitive/psychiatric disorders.

While triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) do not cross the placenta, thyroxine (T4) does. Thyroid hormone demands peaks between weeks 16 and 20 of pregnancy and remains high until delivery. There is a rise in the levels of thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), during the period of pregnancy, raising total T4 and T3 levels while TSH levels usually decrease. Pregnancy-related thyroid disorders, such as hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITD), carry the potential to impair the well-being of both the child as well as the mother. A range of 5-20% of women belonging to the reproductive age group have AITD, which can be associated with the possibility of infertility, miscarriages, and/or poor pregnancy outcomes. If improperly managed, overt hypothyroidism can cause severe complications such as developmental delay and preeclampsia. Effective management requires regular monitoring and appropriate treatment adjustment. Treatment for hypothyroidism involves levothyroxine, whereas cautious use of antithyroid medications is advised for hyperthyroidism. Postpartum thyroiditis (PPT), an autoimmune condition occurring after childbirth, requires careful management to address both hyperthyroid and hypothyroid phases. A comprehensive understanding and management of these conditions are critical for optimizing maternal and fetal health outcomes. Thyroid disorders are common in women of reproductive age group.",Thyroid Disorders

40877048,Challenges in respiratory medicine: the need for integrated tuberculosis and respiratory care in low-resource settings.,"Pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) are intricately linked. People with PTB and CRDs experience similar symptoms, including breathlessness, cough and chest pain. They may have similar risk factors for disease, including smoking and occupational exposures. PTB is also a direct cause of lung damage in the form of post-TB lung disease. However, despite the overlap in risk factors, symptoms and sequelae, public health and clinical care pathways for TB and CRDs remain almost entirely separate in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Those with respiratory symptoms are directed to TB services as a first point of contact where they are known as 'people with presumptive TB', and pathways to respiratory diagnosis and care remain largely inadequate.",Respiratory Care

40852783,Prevalence and clinical characteristics of fibromyalgia syndrome in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A cross-sectional study.,"ObjectiveThis study investigated the prevalence of fibromyalgia syndrome in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and examined its association with the demographic and clinical variables of these individuals.MethodsA cross-sectional design was used to compare 100 individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with 100 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Fibromyalgia syndrome was diagnosed based on the 2016 American College of Rheumatology criteria.ResultsThe prevalence of fibromyalgia syndrome was significantly greater in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (16%) than in healthy controls (3%) (p = 0.048). In the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease group, female patients exhibited a markedly higher prevalence of fibromyalgia syndrome than male patients (31.6% vs. 6.4%, p = 0.035). No significant associations were found between the presence of fibromyalgia syndrome and patient age, disease duration, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease severity. Patients with both chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and fibromyalgia syndrome frequently reported increased fatigue, sleep disturbances, and depressive symptoms.ConclusionsThese findings underscore the clinical relevance of fibromyalgia syndrome as a comorbidity in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, particularly in women, and highlight the need for its routine screening in respiratory care. Incorporating fibromyalgia syndrome assessment may improve symptom management and support a more holistic approach to rehabilitation and disease management in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients.",Respiratory Care

Successful delivery of NIV is challenging to multiple healthcare professionals involved in the respiratory care patient journey and considering their perspectives is crucial in order to understand how to deliver optimal care. Objective: To identify the factors that influence NIV delivery in MND from a healthcare professional perspective and understand how obstacles can be overcome to optimize care. Methods: Qualitative focus group discussions with healthcare professionals delivering respiratory care and support to MND patients in the UK and charity representatives. Results: Thirty healthcare professionals and three charity representatives participated in five focus groups. A range of factors that influence the delivery of NIV across the entire respiratory care pathway were identified. These were grouped under four main themes: multidisciplinary working; NIV service structure; professional further education and training; and good use of NIV and effective ventilation. Conclusions: There is a need for specific resources to support service delivery; frequent, funded, and structured training to support healthcare professionals to deliver good care; as well as ways to encourage optimal staff practice so patients get the best care.",Respiratory Care
40840465,Design method of a bidirectional flow meter for a metered dose inhaler.,"This paper presents the design of a bidirectional flow meter for metered-dose inhalers, addressing the challenge of accurately measuring airflow over vastly different ranges: 0-150 L/min for inhalation and up to 700 L/min for exhalation to capture peak expiratory flow. The design process utilized numerical simulations to understand the complex flow physics and a series of physical measurements to determine the precise influence of two critical geometric parameters: the width and height of the proposed flow element. Results demonstrate a predictable quadratic relationship between pressure drop and flow rate in both directions. Notably, the exhalation measurement range was found to be highly sensitive to the flow element's height, while the inhalation measurement remained robust against minor geometric variations. This process yields a validated flow meter that adds minimal resistance to the inhaler, enabling the accurate quantification of patient-specific respiratory waveforms for improved drug deposition studies and efficacy assessment.",Respiratory Care

Despite the availability of clinical guidelines and newly published Standards of Care, variability in healthcare professionals' (HCPs) familiarity with NTM-LD results in delayed diagnoses, inconsistent care, and suboptimal patient outcomes. Based on our own experiences as NTM-LD patients, we highlight key issues in the management of NTM-LD, including diagnostic inefficiencies, variable access to specialized care, mixed experience of empathy, and insufficient information provision. We provide recommendations that we hope will optimize the patient journey and improve outcomes for individuals with NTM-LD. These include improving HCP education, ensuring the involvement of a multidisciplinary team from the point of diagnosis, enhancing patient participation in decision-making, and promoting access to support networks. The challenges and solutions we propose are globally relevant and highlight the need for clear communication and integrated care pathways.

40806268,A Multimodal AI Framework for Automated Multiclass Lung Disease Diagnosis from Respiratory Sounds with Simulated Biomarker Fusion and Personalized Medication Recommendation.,"Respiratory diseases represent a persistent global health challenge, underscoring the need for intelligent, accurate, and personalized diagnostic and therapeutic systems. Existing methods frequently suffer from limitations in diagnostic precision, lack of individualized treatment, and constrained adaptability to complex clinical scenarios. To address these challenges, our study introduces a modular AI-powered framework that integrates an audio-based disease classification model with simulated molecular biomarker profiles to evaluate the feasibility of future multimodal diagnostic extensions, alongside a synthetic-data-driven prescription recommendation engine. The disease classification model analyzes respiratory sound recordings and accurately distinguishes among eight clinical classes: bronchiectasis, pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiolitis, and healthy respiratory state. The proposed model achieved a classification accuracy of 99.99% on a holdout test set, including 94.2% accuracy on pediatric samples. In parallel, the prescription module provides individualized treatment recommendations comprising drug, dosage, and frequency trained on a carefully constructed synthetic dataset designed to emulate real-world prescribing logic.The model achieved over 99% accuracy in medication prediction tasks, outperforming baseline models such as those discussed in research. Minimal misclassification in the confusion matrix and strong clinician agreement on 200 prescriptions (Cohen's κ = 0.91 [0.87-0.94] for drug selection, 0.78 [0.74-0.81] for dosage, 0.96 [0.93-0.98] for frequency) further affirm the system's reliability. Adjusted clinician disagreement rates were 2.7% (drug), 6.4% (dosage), and 1.5% (frequency). SHAP analysis identified age and smoking as key predictors, enhancing model explainability. Dosage accuracy was 91.3%, and most disagreements occurred in renal-impaired and pediatric cases. However, our study is presented strictly as a proof-of-concept. The use of synthetic data and the absence of access to real patient records constitute key limitations. A trialed clinical deployment was conducted under a controlled environment with a positive rate of satisfaction from experts and users, but the proposed system must undergo extensive validation with de-identified electronic medical records (EMRs) and regulatory scrutiny before it can be considered for practical application. Nonetheless, the findings offer a promising foundation for the future development of clinically viable AI-assisted respiratory care tools.",Respiratory Care
40779701,The evolving landscape of digital inhaler platforms and adherence support in chronic airways disease.,"Inhaled therapies remain the cornerstone in managing chronic airway diseases, offering direct treatment delivery to the lungs with minimal systemic adverse effects. With advancements in respiratory care, digital inhalers have emerged as a transformative innovation. Their functions extend beyond delivering inhaled medication, providing deeper insights into patients' medication use behaviour and intervening through complementary platform features and integrated data analytics. However, despite being available for over two decades, the widespread adoption of digital inhaler platforms remains limited due to uncertainties regarding their cost-effectiveness, feasibility in real-world settings, and concerns regarding sustainability. Identifying patient groups that could benefit most from these technologies and designing strategies for effective deployment across diverse healthcare contexts is important. To achieve this, bridging the gap between innovation and accessibility is required so that digital inhaler platforms evolve into inclusive, patient-centred tools rather than niche technologies. This narrative review provides a summary of the evolution and current landscape of digital inhaler technology, its impact on clinical outcomes in chronic airway disease, and key challenges that stakeholders should address for the successful integration of these tools into respiratory care. We also propose key components of a patient-centred digital inhaler adherence support model that prioritises accessibility and efficacy.",Respiratory Care

40697038,Integration of Respiratory Care Experts and Emerging Technologies in Critical Care Simulation.,"Respiratory Therapists (RTs) are indispensable members of the critical care team, yet their participation in the design and facilitation simulation-based training (SBT) remains significantly underrepresented. SBT provides healthcare professionals a risk-free environment to develop and maintain clinical and team skills, prepare for uncommon, high-risk scenarios and receive real-time feedback. This review examines critical contributions of RTs, encompassing their expertise in invasive procedures, mechanical ventilation management, and the burgeoning role of Advanced Practice Respiratory Therapists (APRTs). We explore the professional evolution of critical care and the parallel advancements in simulation technology, creating opportunities to enhance the training of all healthcare professionals. RTs possess unique clinical and technical skills ideally suited for the design and facilitation of critical care simulations. Their inclusion offers a powerful means to improve team training and patient outcomes. Integrating RTs into simulation programs has proven challenging. Resource limitations and staffing constraints require a multifaceted solution including dedicated full-time equivalents (FTEs) in simulation programs, specialized training in simulation pedagogy, and fostering robust interprofessional collaboration opportunities for RTs. Research demonstrating the return on investment (ROI) of integrating RTs into simulation is lacking, but remains crucial to securing the necessary resources and support. Research should focus on quantifiable improvements in trainee performance, team dynamics, and patient safety metrics. By fully integrating RTs into SBT, healthcare institutions can significantly enhance the quality of critical care training, fostering improved interprofessional teamwork, leading to better patient outcomes. This strategic investment in RT participation in SBT will yield substantial returns in improved healthcare delivery.",Respiratory Care

40643011,Protocols and Pathways in Pediatric Critical Asthma: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Background: Pediatric critical asthma is one of the most frequent reasons for presentation to the emergency department and admission to the floor or pediatric ICU (PICU) in pediatric patients. Clinical pathways and protocols have been used frequently in respiratory care, and many have been associated with an improvement in outcomes. We performed a systematic review on the use of protocols or pathways in the treatment of critical asthma. Methods: MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL were searched with no date limits; last search was completed in July 2024 to identify randomized controlled trials, crossover studies, observational studies, and quality improvement (QI) studies comparing the use of a protocol or pathway in the treatment of pediatric critical asthma to the standard of care. Abstracts were screened by a subgroup of the clinical practice guidelines committee, and subsequently full-text articles were screened and data were extracted. A fixed-effect meta-analysis was performed for each outcome. Results: We included 23 studies, with the majority being observational or QI studies. The outcomes included in this analysis were hospital stay, PICU stay, intubation rate, noninvasive respiratory support (NRS) usage, and rate of escalation of respiratory support. Use of clinical pathways and/or protocols was associated with a shorter hospital stay (mean difference [MD] -0.77 d [95% CI -0.81 to -0.73]) and PICU stay (MD -0.31 d [95% CI -0.37 to -0.26]). There was a decreased incidence of the need for increased respiratory support (odds ratio [OR] 0.59 [95% CI 0.39-0.59]). There was no change in the need for intubation (OR 0.4 [95% CI 0.12-1.34]) or incidence of NRS usage (OR 1.12 [95% CI 0.76-1.63]). Conclusions: Pediatric asthma protocols were associated with reductions in hospital stay, PICU stay, and decreased need for respiratory support escalation but not intubation or NRS use.",Respiratory Care
40642591,Is Abrupt Withdrawal of Benzodiazepines a Risk Factor for Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome? A Case Report With Single-Dose Haloperidol.,"Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a rare but life-threatening reaction associated with the use of dopamine-modulating agents, which presents with symptoms like high fever, muscle rigidity, and autonomic instability. It is known that both the use of dopamine receptor antagonists and the sudden withdrawal of dopamine receptor agonists can trigger NMS. Benzodiazepine withdrawal can create a GABA-deficient state, linked to catatonia and possibly predisposing individuals to NMS. The case was a 53-year-old male patient with a history of high-dose benzodiazepine dependency, who developed NMS after the abrupt withdrawal of alprazolam and the single-dose intramuscular (IM) haloperidol. He presented with the symptoms of stupor, generalized rigidity, and fever, requiring admission to the Respiratory Care Unit. His medical history included long-term use of clonazepam, alprazolam, and methadone maintenance therapy (MMT). The laboratory findings also demonstrated elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels, peaking at 7896 IU/L. The treatments with bromocriptine and lorazepam further led to gradual improvement, and the patient was discharged after 11 days following the resolution of NMS symptoms. This case highlights the potential role of benzodiazepine withdrawal as a risk factor for NMS, especially when combined with antipsychotic medication like haloperidol. The shared mechanisms between the pathophysiology of NMS and benzodiazepine withdrawal suggest that the abrupt cessation of GABAergic agents may lower dopaminergic activity, contributing to the onset of NMS. Clinicians must be accordingly cautious in distinguishing benzodiazepine withdrawal from other causes of delirium and then option for appropriate treatment approaches to mitigate risks.",Respiratory Care

40632243,Prevalence of Stroke-Associated Pneumonia and Associated Factors Among Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients with Dysphagia.,"Stroke-associated pneumonia is a common complication in acute ischemic stroke patients, particularly those with dysphagia. Although some studies have addressed stroke-associated pneumonia, research remains limited on this issue among acute ischemic stroke patients with dysphagia, especially in Vietnam. This study used data from a prior cross-sectional study conducted at Bach Mai Hospital in Hanoi, Vietnam. A total of 681 acute ischemic stroke patients with dysphagia were included in the study. The outcome variable was the occurrence of stroke-associated pneumonia within seven days of post-stroke. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess associations with stroke-associated pneumonia. The prevalence of stroke-associated pneumonia among acute ischemic stroke patients with dysphagia was 10.3%. Stroke-associated pneumonia was significantly associated with age > 70 years (AOR: 2.0, 95% CI: 1.1-3.7, P = 0.02), combined or other stroke locations (AOR: 2.6, 95% CI: 1.03-6.3, P = 0.04), National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score > 14 (AOR: 2.8, 95% CI: 1.4-5.6, P < 0.01), tube feeding (AOR: 3.9, 95% CI: 1.7-8.9, P < 0.01), and hospital stays longer than 14 days (AOR: 3.7, 95% CI: 1.6-8.5, P < 0.01). We found that stroke-associated pneumonia accounts for a significant proportion of stroke patients with dysphagia. The status of stroke-associated pneumonia is associated with older age, specific stroke locations, higher stroke severity, tube feeding, and prolonged hospitalization. We suggest prioritizing respiratory care and physiotherapy, particularly for elderly patients, individuals with severe strokes, those undergoing tube feeding, and those experiencing prolonged hospitalization.",Respiratory Care

40614834,Respiratory physiological changes in pregnancy.,"Pregnancy induces a wide range of physiological changes in the respiratory system that significantly affect pulmonary function and gas exchange. These changes are mediated by both mechanical factors-such as the expanding uterus and elevation of the diaphragm-and hormonal influences, particularly from progesterone, estrogen, relaxin, and prostaglandins. Progesterone and estrogen increase minute ventilation and reduce arterial PaCO2, while relaxin enhances ligamentous flexibility, allowing ribcage expansion to accommodate the growing fetus. Anatomical adaptations, including diaphragm elevation and an increased subcostal angle, begin early in gestation and peak in the third trimester. Lung volumes are altered, with a notable decrease in functional residual capacity (FRC) and an increase in inspiratory capacity (IC). Despite these changes in thoracic mechanics, spirometric measures such as FEV1 and FVC typically remain unchanged. These respiratory adjustments often result in symptoms like exertional dyspnea and predispose individuals to conditions such as obstructive sleep apnea and pulmonary edema. During labor, hyperventilation can be further exacerbated by pain and anxiety. Distinguishing these normal physiological adaptations from serious pathologies-such as pulmonary embolism, peripartum cardiomyopathy, and preeclampsia-is critical for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of current knowledge while offering a unique perspective by integrating hormonal and mechanical drivers of change, mapping their evolution across gestation, and linking them to real-world clinical implications. These insights aim to support clinicians in optimizing respiratory care during pregnancy, labor, and the postpartum period.",Respiratory Care

This single-center retrospective study examines the evolving risk factors for postoperative mortality following hip fracture surgery among older adults in Taiwan during its transition to an aged society. We analyzed data from 1,545 patients aged over 65 years who underwent hip fracture surgery at Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital between 2011 and 2020, comparing outcomes before and after 2018-the year Taiwan officially became an aged society. The overall one-year postoperative mortality rate was 6.0%. Significant predictors of increased mortality included advanced age, male sex, ORIF surgical approach, hepatic disease, coronary artery disease, and notably, in-hospital complications such as aspiration pneumonia and UGI bleeding. Our findings revealed that aspiration pneumonia's impact on mortality intensified significantly in the post-2018 period, highlighting the changing risk profile as Taiwan's population ages. This study provides critical insights for developing targeted interventions and specialized postoperative care protocols for elderly hip fracture patients, particularly focusing on respiratory care and dysphagia screening. These findings have important implications for healthcare systems adapting to demographic shifts toward super-aged societies.",Respiratory Care

40585720,Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Exacerbated by Inappropriate Use of Mechanical Insufflation-Exsufflation Following Infection in a Patient With Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Case Report.,"Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) is widely used to assist airway secretion clearance in patients with neuromuscular disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). While MI-E is generally considered safe when used intermittently for cough augmentation, its prolonged and unsupervised use as a substitute for invasive ventilation is discouraged by current clinical guidelines, including those issued by the American College of Chest Physicians and the American Academy of Neurology. We report the case of a 53-year-old man with advanced ALS, diagnosed approximately 10 years earlier, who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) exacerbated by inappropriate use of MI-E following a recent respiratory infection. The patient had previously relied on tracheostomy invasive ventilation (TIV) but chose to suspend its use, instead employing MI-E continuously for 62 hours (28,234 cycles), based on prior positive experiences and personal preference. Upon hospital admission, the patient was diagnosed with mild ARDS, bacterial pneumonia, and influenza B infection. Although the respiratory infection was likely the primary cause of deterioration, MI-E-related pressure changes may have exacerbated pulmonary injury, particularly in the context of acute infection. Rapid improvement in gas exchange and imaging findings within 48 hours of MI-E discontinuation further supports this hypothesis. We discuss possible mechanisms linking excessive MI-E usage to lung injury, including barotrauma and negative pressure pulmonary edema. We also emphasize the importance of clearly defined device indications, structured caregiver education, and regular clinical supervision in home respiratory care. To our knowledge, this may be the first reported case of ARDS potentially resulting from the combined effects of infection and inappropriate MI-E application, highlighting the need for multidisciplinary coordination and proper device supervision in managing advanced neuromuscular respiratory failure at home.",Respiratory Care

HTS use decreased during the study period, with a change in the prior trend to downward (-3.43; -5.89-9.68; P = 0.007). There was no significant change in albuterol or pulmonary hygiene treatment. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that patterns of oxygen and HTS use in a pLTCF changed during the COVID-19 pandemic.",Respiratory Care
40539137,Long-Term Survival in Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere Syndrome: A Case Report Highlighting Respiratory Care.,"Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome (BVVLS) is an extremely rare genetic neurological disorder caused by riboflavin transport deficiency, an autosomal recessive condition mostly associated with mutations in the SLC52A2 and SLC52A3 genes. It follows a progressive course, typically characterized by sensorineural deafness, facial weakness, ponto-bulbar palsy, ataxia, and peripheral sensory-motor neuropathy. This disease is often associated with childhood mortality if left untreated. We report the case of a 68-year-old woman who first noticed a mild hearing loss at the age of 12. This was followed by a slowly progressive onset of bilateral facial paresis, dysarthro-dysphonia, stridor, and tongue atrophy with fasciculations. At 63 years of age, genetic testing revealed a single heterozygous variant in the SLC52A3 gene. Although typically autosomal recessive, some individuals with classic symptoms and even response to riboflavin therapy have been found to carry only a single mutation in either the SLC52A2 or SLC52A3 gene. Therefore, given the compatible clinical presentation, a diagnosis of BVVLS was considered after discussion with a center of expertise. Consequently, 10 mg/kg/day of riboflavin supplementation was prescribed for three years, but no significant clinical improvement was observed. Currently, at age 68, the patient is on nocturnal non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) and uses assisted airway clearance techniques, including air-stacking maneuvers and mechanical insufflation-exsufflation on demand, due to respiratory compromise secondary to diaphragmatic weakness and vocal cord paralysis. This unique presentation of slowly progressive symptoms and long survival may be related to the single heterozygous SLC52A3 variant found. Respiratory care in BVVLS is currently adapted from other neuromuscular disorders with stronger evidence bases. This case highlights the critical role of pulmonology in BVVLS care, including clinical and functional monitoring, early initiation of NIV, and the implementation of airway clearance techniques.",Respiratory Care

40519505,Importance of Individualized Pressure Settings in Mechanical Insufflation-Exsufflation for Lung Volume Recruitment: A Case Report.,"Lung volume recruitment (LVR) has been proposed as a treatment to maintain respiratory health in patients with neuromuscular diseases who frequently develop restrictive ventilatory impairment due to muscle weakness. LVR applies noninvasive mechanical pressure techniques to maintain and improve pulmonary and chest wall compliance and to preserve vital capacity. Various methods of LVR have been developed, which can be classified into two types: the stacked-breath method and the single-breath method. Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) is one approach categorized under the single-breath method. Although the clinical use of pressure settings in MI-E varies, inspiratory pressure levels around 40 cmH₂O are sometimes applied in practice. However, such settings may result in patient discomfort and raise safety concerns. Given the limited clinical guidance available, it may be more appropriate to determine individualized settings based on each patient's impairment level, pulmonary mechanics, and tolerance. This case report describes such an approach to LVR using the single-breath method with MI-E in a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). To determine the optimal inspiratory pressure, three parameters were assessed at each pressure level: expiratory volume, subjective perception of lung expansion, and immediate subjective effects following inspiration. As the patient reported discomfort at 30 cmH₂O, the final inspiratory pressure was set at 25 cmH₂O. This level of inspiratory assistance led to improvements in vocal loudness and alleviated breathlessness during speech. These positive effects contributed to the patient's acceptance of the intervention and its continued use after discharge to home care. This case highlights the importance of tailoring LVR settings to optimize effectiveness, patient comfort, and safety, based on pulmonary mechanics, bedside volume assessment, and patient-reported respiratory status.",Respiratory Care

In respiratory care, evidence supporting their clinical use remains fragmented and inconclusive. This study aimed to assess the current research landscape of digital audio biomarkers in respiratory medicine through a bibliometric analysis and systematic review (PROSPERO CRD 42022336730). MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library and CINAHL were searched for references indexed up to 9 April 2024. Eligible studies evaluated the accuracy of sound analysis for diagnosing and managing obstructive (asthma and COPD) or infectious respiratory diseases, excluding COVID-19. A narrative synthesis was conducted, and the QUADAS-2 tool was used to assess study quality and risk of bias. Of 14 180 studies, 81 were included. Bibliometric analysis identified fundamental (e.g. ""diagnostic accuracy""+""machine learning"") and emerging (e.g. ""developing countries"") themes. Despite methodological heterogeneity, audio biomarkers generally achieved moderate (60-79%) to high (80-100%) accuracies. 80% of studies (eight out of ten) reported high sensitivities and specificities for asthma diagnosis, 78% (seven out of nine) reported high sensitivities and 56% (five out of nine) reported high specificities for COPD, and 64% (seven out of eleven) reported high sensitivity or specificity values for pneumonia diagnosis. Breathing and coughing were the most common biomarkers, with artificial neural networks being the most common analysis technique.

However, many practitioners are apprehensive about advancing their degrees past the entry-into-practice level. Little research exists regarding the benefits of a graduate-level degree in RC. Methods: A web-based survey was developed to identify the perceived benefits of completing a master's of science in RC (MSRC) program. Graduates from 7 MSRC programs were asked to identify how efficacious the program was in preparing them for new or expanded roles, what types of financial support were received, whether there exists a financial benefit to obtain the degree, and whether the degree supported professional advancement. Two hundred ninety-nine graduates were invited to complete the anonymous web-based survey. One hundred one surveys were initiated, and 98 (32.8%) responses were analyzed. Results: Seventy-two percent of respondents indicated personal motivation for pursuing a graduate-level degree as well as a desire to stay in the field; 89% of respondents indicated that the program prepared them to assume new or expanded roles, and 58% had experienced advancement. Forty-five percent of respondents did not receive tuition reimbursement for degree advancement, and 88% did not receive any scholarship support toward the degree. Finally, graduates reported an average increase in salary of approximately $12,000. Conclusions: Attainment of a graduate-level RC degree through degree advancement remains reliant on intrinsic motivation. Although over half of respondents indicated receiving tuition support through an employer, opportunities continue to exist to increase financial support for clinicians to advance their education beyond the clinical requirements of licensure. Graduates indicated that earning the degree supported educational development, contributed to new or advanced roles, and contributed to a tangible increase in annual salary.",Respiratory Care

Human respiratory and cardiovascular diseases induced by UFPs strongly depend on their regional and total deposition fraction (TDF) in the respiratory tract. This study investigated the deposition of UFPs in various respiratory tract regions through transient and size-resolved measurement technique. Twenty healthy volunteers (10 males, 10 females) inhaled polydisperse NaCl particles (10-100 nm) under different conditions: breath-holding times (5, 10, and 15 s), inhalation flow rates (200, 400, and 600 L/min), and particle concentrations (0.5 ×105, 1 ×105, 1.5 ×105 particles/cm³). An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to assess the fit and significance of the design of experiments (DoE) model. This analysis evaluated the significance of individual parameters as well as their interactive effects on the TDF. The results show that the mean TDF under all test conditions was slightly lower in females (0.910 ± 0.0021) than in males (0.921 ± 0.0023). The air exhaled at the end of the breath from the deep alveolar region contained fewer UFPs than that from the conducting region, as it resided longer in the respiratory tract. Moreover, the results revealed that men are more sensitive to changes in the influencing factors (e.g., particle size, inhalation flow rate, breath-holding time, and particle concentration) than women. This study reveals the dynamics of UFPs deposition across different regions of the human respiratory tract, emphasizing sex-specific differences and key influencing factors. These findings provide valuable insights for developing targeted public health strategies, respiratory care approaches, and improved air quality regulations, with implications for environmental safety and occupational health.",Respiratory Care

40116324,Optimizing respiratory care: clinical pharmacist interventions in respiratory tract infection management at a tertiary teaching hospital.,"Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are prevalent in India, affecting approximately 11.3% of the population. India leads globally in lung disease mortality, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, contributing significantly to disability-adjusted life years and mortality rates. The role of clinical pharmacist interventions (CPIs) in optimizing antibiotic use and managing RTIs is increasingly recognized as vital for improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of CPIs in managing RTIs among inpatients at Vivekananda General Hospital, Hubballi, and to identify common drug-related problems (DRPs) using the Hepler-Strand classification system. A cross-sectional study was conducted over 6 months, including 200 inpatients diagnosed with RTIs. Data was collected through patient profiles, treatment charts, and medical case sheets. The study employed descriptive and inferential statistical analyses to evaluate the impact of CPIs on antibiotic therapy and the prevalence of DRPs. The study identified drug-drug interactions as the most frequent DRP (38.30%), followed by drug duplication (31.49%) and improper drug selection (9.79%). Other issues included adverse drug reactions (4.68%), overdosage (5.53%), untreated indications (6.38%), subtherapeutic dosage (2.13%), and drug use without indication (1.70%). CPIs, including prospective audits, prescription feedback, and healthcare professional education, effectively addressed these issues, improved antibiotic appropriateness, and optimized patient outcomes. CPIs significantly enhance the management of RTIs by addressing various DRPs and optimizing antibiotic use. The study underscores the importance of incorporating pharmacists into antimicrobial stewardship programs to improve medication safety, efficacy, and overall patient care in managing RTIs. Continued emphasis on pharmacist-led interventions and adherence to best practices in antimicrobial stewardship is essential for reducing the burden of respiratory diseases in India.",Respiratory Care

Medical records of undiagnosed exudative lymphocytic predominant pleural effusion patients who underwent MT during the study period of 24 months were retrieved from the Medical Records Department. The clinico-demographic profile, radiological images, gross thoracoscopy findings, HPE reports, and post-procedure complications were recorded and analyzed using analysis of variance and chi-square test. The study comprised 62 patients with a mean age of 52 years at presentation. HPE of MT-guided biopsy confirmed tuberculosis in 22 (35.3%), malignancy in 18 (29%) cases, and 22 (35.5%) cases had chronic nonspecific inflammation. The most commonly observed MT finding in malignancy was pleural nodules (14.70%), followed by thickened pleura (10.50%) and growth (2.10%). In tuberculosis, the most common MT finding was adhesions in all, followed by nodules (5.28%). We also diagnosed a case of pleural amoebiasis and ependymoma, which are rare. Macroscopic findings had a significant correlation with the final histopathologic diagnosis, with a diagnostic yield of 66.1%. Gross thoracoscopic findings correlate well with the histopathological diagnosis of pleural effusion etiology, with a correlation coefficient of 0.73. Pleural nodules were the most common finding in malignancy, while adhesions were common in benign pathology like tuberculosis. A good diagnostic yield underscores the utility of MT in undiagnosed exudative lymphocytic pleural effusions.",Respiratory Care
40095670,Improved Survival in Patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Hospitalized for Acute Exacerbation.,"Background: Patients suffering from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) may experience acute exacerbation (AE-IPF), which frequently results in acute respiratory failure (ARF) requiring hospitalization. Objective: This study aims to determine if survival has improved over the last decade in patients hospitalized for ARF consequent to AE-IPF, in view of the progress recently made in pharmacological and supportive treatment strategies. Methods: This was an observational retrospective single-center study. The data of 14 patients admitted to an Intermediate Respiratory Care Unit (IRCU) between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2013 (group A) were compared with those of 26 patients admitted between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2023 (group B). This study's primary endpoint was survival following IRCU admission. Results: Survival time was significantly longer in the second group of patients compared to the first one [median survival time: 134 (31-257) vs. 25.5 (20-50) days; p < 0.001]. Group B patients also had a lower IRCU mortality rate (6/26 vs. 10/14; p = 0.003) and a significantly shorter stay in the IRCU [6 (1-60) vs. 14 (1-43) days; p = 0.039]. Conclusions: Innovative pharmacologic treatments and supportive therapeutic strategies are able to prolong survival and reduce the risk of in-hospital mortality in patients with AE-IPF hospitalized for ARF.",Respiratory Care

40089496,The asthma diagnosis jigsaw puzzle: an adaptable teaching concept to facilitate the diagnosis of asthma in adults and children presenting to primary care.,"The asthma diagnosis jigsaw puzzle is a clinical practice and teaching concept conceived in clinical practice and refined through an expert multidisciplinary consensus process by academics and clinicians with an interest in primary respiratory care. The concept incorporates guidance to facilitate the effective diagnosis of adults or children with asthma in primary care where misdiagnosis is common. The jigsaw puzzle metaphor teaches a problem-solving approach to diagnosis, introducing the concept of diagnosis over time and in no particular sequence. Puzzle pieces can be collected from the domains of presentation, history, symptoms and physical examination, as well as objective tests. The clinician's challenge is to complete the diagnostic jigsaw puzzle testing the likelihood of a picture which can be recognised as asthma. This approach aligns with symptom-based pattern-recognition approaches taught to primary care clinicians which gets easier and more reliable with experience. Relational continuity, or informational continuity through the patient record, is integral to the process of puzzle completion. Where non-fitting puzzle pieces are encountered, alternative or additional diagnoses should be considered and/or referral to secondary care pursued. As a metaphor, 'puzzle completion' may be used within clinical communication encounters, addressing the importance of partnership working ('completing the puzzle together'), uncertainty (deciding 'which pieces fit') and changes in symptoms over time (enabling the 'puzzle picture to become clearer'). Adaptation of this teaching concept has started through translation of educational resources, including puzzle pieces. Supporting case vignettes developed locally will contextualise the jigsaw puzzle teaching concept. The Asthma Diagnosis Jigsaw Puzzle teaching concept has been piloted in North Macedonia and is also developed for educational workshops by primary care health educators in Malaysia, India and Uganda.",Respiratory Care
40087173,[Challenges and physiotherapeutic solutions for obese patients in the acute and postacute intensive care setting].,"Physical therapy for obese patients in intensive care units (ICUs) presents a significant challenge. Particularly, class III obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 40, previously called morbid obesity) is associated with specific pathophysiological aspects such as reduced lung compliance, increased intra-abdominal pressure, and impaired respiratory mechanics. These factors complicate both ventilation and early rehabilitation, particularly in the areas of respiratory physiotherapy, exercise therapy, and early mobilization. This article outlines the physiotherapeutic challenges and strategies for dealing with obese patients in ICUs and respiratory intermediate care units (respiratory care units [RCUs]). Special emphasis is placed on the individual positioning of patients, an optimal positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) adjustment, and early mobilization. Additionally, the concept of ICU-acquired weakness (ICUAW) is discussed, which is exacerbated in obese patients due to simultaneous inflammation activation and reinforcing immobilization. An exemplary case study illustrates the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and the use of a structured mobilization concept tailored to the specific needs of obese patients. Particularly, the early initiation of assisted mobilization, the continuous adjustment of ventilation, and the use of innovative techniques to support respiratory physiotherapy contribute to a significant improvement in patient's functionality and quality of life.",Respiratory Care

40055099,NIPPV vs CPAP: Lessons from meta-analyses.,"Care of the extremely premature infant has been in constant state of re-evaluation as the population, technologies and knowledge continue to evolve. A growing population of extremely low gestational age neonates (ELGAN - <28 weeks) and ""nanopremies"" (<24 weeks) are undergoing successful resuscitation, stabilization, and intensive care leading to improved survival. Respiratory care is the cornerstone of ELGAN management, as their lungs are at a critical stage of development. The lifesaving intensive care they require can lead to various injurious stimuli making them prone to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Non-invasive ventilation (NIV), including continuous positive airway pressure ventilation (CPAP) and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) has evolved and can appropriately support premature infants' breathing, while limiting the invasiveness and associated complications of mechanical ventilation. This review focuses on our current understanding, knowledge and evidence gathered via meta-analysis on these two modes of NIV in preterm infants, when used either as primary intent respiratory support post-birth or following extubation. We will summarize the current data of recent meta-analyses, their pitfalls, and the remaining questions to be addressed by future research to optimize the use of these modes of respiratory support in preterm infants most at risk for BPD.",Respiratory Care
40028879,Empowering Respiratory Therapists to Restrict Nebulized 3% Saline and N-Acetylcysteine During Mechanical Ventilation.,"Background: We previously implemented a policy that enabled respiratory therapists to reject orders for nebulized 3% hypertonic saline and/or N-acetylcysteine (HTS/NAC) that did not conform to the American Association for Respiratory Care (AARC) Clinical Practice Guideline. Outcomes of adhering to this more conservative approach are not well studied. We sought to determine if an approach conforming to guidelines is noninferior to a previously practiced more liberal approach. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 2,272 subjects receiving mechanical ventilation ≥48 h within 5 adult ICUs between June 2020 and August 2023. The primary outcome was ventilator-free days at day 28 (VFD28). Secondary outcomes included ventilator days, ICU days, hospital stay, re-intubation rates, and mortality. Analysis was stratified by before and after policy implementation (see intervention) and by receiving HTS/NAC or not (ϕHTS/NAC). The latter was examined before and after propensity matching. The Δ for noninferiority was -0.5 days for VFD28 and +0.5 days for other continuous variables. As outcomes were not normally distributed, we analyzed them using Mann-Whitney U statistics. Results: Two thousand two hundred seventy-two subjects were evaluated. The mean age was 58.70 + 16.13 years and 929 (40.9%) subjects were women. HTS/NAC administration was reduced after policy implementation (40.2% before policy and 8.9% after policy; a reduction of 77.9%). The post-policy group and ϕHTS/NAC before and after propensity matching groups were all noninferior to the comparators. Subjects had significantly more VFD28 in the post-policy group, median (IQR), post 21 (0-25), pre: 20 (0-24), P = .02; and in the ϕHTS/NAC group, before matching ϕHTS/NAC: 21 (0-25), HTS/NAC: 18 (0-23), P < .001 and after propensity matching ϕHTS/NAC: 21 (0-25), HTS/NAC; 18 (0-23), P < .001. Conclusions: Restricting practice to conform to the AARC Clinical Practice Guideline was noninferior to more liberal use. The use of HTS/NAC in mechanically ventilated subjects does not appear efficacious and is both costly and time-consuming.",Respiratory Care

40002767,Early Diagnosis of Pneumonia and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease with a Smart Stethoscope with Cloud Server-Embedded Machine Learning in the Post-COVID-19 Era.,"Background/Objectives: Respiratory diseases are common and result in high mortality, especially in the elderly, with pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Auscultation of lung sounds using a stethoscope is a crucial method for diagnosis, but it may require specialized training and the involvement of pulmonologists. This study aims to assist medical professionals who are non-pulmonologist doctors in early screening for pneumonia and COPD by developing a smart stethoscope with cloud server-embedded machine learning to diagnose lung sounds. Methods: The smart stethoscope was developed using a Micro-Electro-Mechanical system (MEMS) microphone to record lung sounds in the mobile application and then send them wirelessly to a cloud server for real-time machine learning classification. Results: The model of the smart stethoscope classifies lung sounds into four categories: normal, pneumonia, COPD, and other respiratory diseases. It achieved an accuracy of 89%, a sensitivity of 89.75%, and a specificity of 95%. In addition, testing with healthy volunteers yielded an accuracy of 80% in distinguishing normal and diseased lungs. Moreover, the performance comparison between the smart stethoscope and two commercial auscultation stethoscopes showed comparable sound quality and loudness results. Conclusions: The smart stethoscope holds great promise for improving healthcare delivery in the post-COVID-19 era, offering the probability of the most likely respiratory conditions for early diagnosis of pneumonia, COPD, and other respiratory diseases. Its user-friendly design and machine learning capabilities provide a valuable resource for non-pulmonologist doctors by delivering timely, evidence-based diagnoses, aiding treatment decisions, and paving the way for more accessible respiratory care.",Respiratory Care
39996070,Innovations and Challenges in Intermediate Respiratory Care Units: Toward Effective Integration into the Hospital System.,"This review gives a comprehensive and nuanced appraisal of the current state of Intermediate Respiratory Care Units (IRCUs). It aims to evaluate the distribution of IRCUs in Spain, identify challenges and gaps in the current system and analyze the impact of IRCUs during the COVID-19 pandemic. A review of the evolution and current state of IRCUs was conducted. A search was performed on PubMed. Original articles were selected for analysis. Additionally, recommendation documents on IRCUs from SEPAR and other Scientific Societies were reviewed. The review analyzes the history and evolution of the IRCUs, their role and function, IRCU models, the evolution of admission criteria, and their efficacy and efficiency. IRCUs offer significant benefits by improving patient outcomes through accurate categorization and specialized treatment of severe pulmonary diseases, ensuring high-quality care. They reduce ICU admission rates, resulting in substantial cost savings for hospitals. Our analysis indicates that while IRCUs contribute positively to patient outcomes and resource optimization in Spain, there are significant challenges related to heterogeneity in unit structures, staffing, and resource allocation. Standardizing definitions and models may enhance the effectiveness and comparability of IRCUs across the healthcare system.",Respiratory Care

A high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is widely used for respiratory failure. Recently, a consensus statement on inhalation therapy with HFNC has been published. However, information regarding the real-world state of inhalation therapy practices in Japan is lacking. Methods An anonymous online questionnaire survey endorsed by three Japanese associations (the Japanese Respiratory Society, Japanese Society of Intensive Care Medicine, and Japanese Society of Respiratory Care Medicine) was administered from October to November 2023. Responses were stratified into three questions: Question A, ""Do you routinely treat patients with asthma and COPD?"" Question B ""Do you routinely perform high-flow therapy?""; and Question C ""How do you provide inhaled SABAs during high-flow therapy in patients with asthma or COPD?"" Patients This questionnaire was distributed to all members of the three societies. Results Of the 567 participants who completed the questionnaire, 387 responded to all 3 questions. When a nebulizer was included in high-flow devices, the frequencies of using an ultrasonic nebulizer, jet, vibrating mesh, other, or not performing nebulization were 49.1%, 30.8%, 5.4%, 0.5%, and 14.2%, respectively; when a nebulizer was included in high-flow devices, these frequencies were 24.0%, 11.1%, 16.0%, 0%, and 48.9%, respectively.

39969932,Perceptions and Barriers to Degree Advancement of Respiratory Therapists.,"Background: The profession of respiratory care has not seen an increase in minimum education requirements in over 40 years; however, the roles and responsibilities of providers have dramatically increased. Although degree advancement (DA) opportunities have increased exponentially to support respiratory therapists (RTs) pursue higher levels of education, the number of RTs who pursue a baccalaureate-level degree remain a small percentage of practitioners, indicating that barriers to advancement exist. The purpose of this study was to identify the perceptions and barriers to DA among active RTs. Method: This cross-sectional study utilized a web-based survey to glean descriptive and qualitative information related to the study questions. The survey was conducted using Qualtrics software and released via a social media platform with a specific audience of over 60,000 practicing RTs. Results: Responses from 785 RTs were included in the final analysis. Relevant findings identified variables such as age, time in the field, likelihood and rate of tuition reimbursement, and compensation post completion of DA all represented perceived barriers to DA. Qualitative analysis of open-ended questions revealed four predominant themes in the perception of DA in respiratory care. These themes included the perception of irrelevance, insurmountable alterations to lifestyle, cost of DA, and age in the context of benefits to DA. Conclusions: Findings support the need for institutions to encourage RTs who are concerned about the cost to return for DA. Other factors such as age and years of experience also play large roles in an individual's choice to return for DA. However, individuals who found financial barriers were more likely to signify a positive indication to return for DA; therefore, it is vital to provide a level of tuition reimbursement to minimize this barrier.",Respiratory Care
39969913,Comparison of Spontaneous Breathing Trials in Clinical Practice and Current Clinical Practice Guidelines.,"Background: The literature suggests there is variability in the clinical practice of spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs). Evidence-based literature and clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) have been published over time to address various aspects of SBT implementation. It can take many years for evidence-based recommendations to be adopted into clinical practice. The American Association for Respiratory Care recently published a CPG addressing 4 aspects of SBT implementation. Methods: This study evaluated how the clinical practice of SBTs compares to the recommendations of the CPG. An online survey was developed to assess how hospitals with SBT protocols perform different components of SBTs. Descriptive statistics were used in the data analysis. Results: A total of 26 representatives from different health care institutions in the United States met the criteria for data analysis; 61.5% of reported protocols use rapid shallow breathing index, which is not in alignment with the current recommendation; 77% reported the use of pressure support (PS); 11.5% specified the use of a T-piece, and 11% specified the option of either PS or T-piece during the SBT. The responses were 100% in alignment with the current recommendation of performing a SBT with or without support; 73.1% aligned with having a standardized approach to performing SBTs by specifying when the SBT will be initiated; 65.4% perform an SBT during the day, though it was not specified if it occurs before noon each day; 53.8% allow for an increase in FIO2 during an SBT, which is not in alignment with the current recommendations. Conclusions: The reported hospitals' protocols demonstrated moderate alignment with the 4 CPG recommendations. Identifying current discrepancies between clinical practice and CPGs will allow for the assessment of the adoption of recommendations into clinical practice over time. Further assessment could be performed to determine if there is an impact on patient outcomes.",Respiratory Care

Parental knowledge and attitudes significantly impact vaccination decisions. Methods: This study analyzed parental knowledge and opinions on childhood vaccinations (focus: measles, pertussis) and assessed vaccination coverage rates in Radomsko, Poland. A cross-sectional study (Jan-Mar 2025) combined the following: (1) parent questionnaires (children aged 6-11 years), including opinions based on the validated VAX scale and (2) analysis of official vaccination coverage data (sanitary inspection). Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics and logistic regression; results are presented as odds ratios (OR). Results: A total of 459 parents participated (mean age 38.9 years, 95% female, 67% Master's-level education). Conclusions: Most correctly identified measles (92%) and pertussis (85%) vaccines as mandatory. Considerable confusion existed about newer mandatory vaccines and varicella (78% incorrectly thought mandatory). Analysis revealed the influence of both knowledge and opinions from the VAX scale on vaccination decisions. Higher parental education significantly increased vaccination adherence for pertussis (OR = 2.03; p < 0.001) and both diseases (OR = 1.83; p < 0.001). While general vaccination awareness was high (97%), detailed knowledge of Poland's mandatory schedule was alarmingly low, especially for newer vaccines.

Higher HPV knowledge scores were positively associated with perceived HPV risk, increasing by approximately 20% per correct response. Approximately 40% of the participants were unaware of the existence of the HPV vaccine, 96.5% had never received the HPV vaccine, and 91.4% had never been offered it. Only 42% indicated that they would consider vaccination if offered. Addressing health disparities in rural Louisiana requires targeted interventions to improve healthcare access, education, and community engagement. Efforts to enhance education and awareness and foster community engagement should be prioritized.",Vaccination Awareness

Around 38,000 cases per year of HPV-related cancers arise in the head and neck region, of which 21,000 cases are oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCCs), with an increasing frequency in high-income countries. In our work, we aimed to collect the available evidence about the awareness of the relation between HPV infection and head and neck cancer among patients and practitioners. Methods: This review was based on all available prospective and retrospective studies, case reports, and review articles published up to May 2024 in PubMed. The search keywords used included ""human papilloma virus"" plus ""head and neck cancer"", ""awareness"", ""infection"", ""vaccination"", ""awareness in patients and practitioners"", ""oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma"", ""HPV16-18"", ""HPV awareness"", ""cervical cancer"". Results: In the U.S.A., with more than 150.00 participants interviewed through different studies, the identification of HPV infection as a risk factor for head and neck cancer (HNC) was made by only 12-39% of the participants. Similar conclusions were drawn from European studies in which only 10-52% of the participants recognized HPV as a risk factor for HNC. HPV-related HNC awareness in health care providers and medical/dental students showed a high variability among studies, being otolaryngology and dental sciences specialists the most conscious in comparison to general practitioners, who demonstrated a low level of awareness. Conclusions: There is a dangerous lack of awareness about HPV infection and its potential role in HNC among both general populations and health care practitioners.

39463710,Molecular Prevalence of Human Papillomavirus Types 16 and 18 in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma using Real-time PCR.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been established as a causative agent in the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Specifically, HPV types 16 and 18 are known to be prevalent in oral cancers. This cross-sectional study aimed to determine the prevalence of HPV types 16 and 18 in OSCC cases in Qazvin province, Iran. Thirty-eight paraffin-embedded samples of OSCC were selected, and DNA extraction was performed using the Roche High Pure FFPE DNA isolation kit. The quality of the extracted DNA was assessed through PCR amplification of the human β-Globin gene. The HPV detection was carried out using SYBR green-based real-time PCR with GP5+ and GP6+ primers targeting the L1 region of HPV. The HPV genotyping was conducted on positive samples using specific primers. Statistical analysis was performed between HPV infection in OSCC and age, sex, and anatomical location. This study analyzed 38 biopsy specimens obtained from male and female OSCC patients, with an average age of 64 years. Among these samples, 13 tested positive for HPV, resulting in a prevalence rate of 34.2%. The age group with the highest HPV infection rate was 61-70 (10.5%) years. Notably, HPV type 16 was detected in 21.0% of samples, HPV type 18 in 10.5%, and other viral subtypes in 2.6%. No statistically significant correlation was found between HPV prevalence and gender or age. The findings indicated that 34.2% of OSCC samples in the Qazvin province harbor HPV, with types 16 and 18 being the most common in tumors affecting the tongue. Additionally, no association was observed between HPV infection and age or gender. To address HPV as a risk factor for OSCC, public health initiatives such as vaccination, awareness campaigns, and accessible healthcare services should be implemented.

39344048,Gender-Neutral HPV Vaccine in India; Requisite for a Healthy Community: A Review.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) affects approximately 80% of individuals, irrespective of gender, and is implicated in various cancers. Existing HPV vaccines, while safe and effective, do not sufficiently protect males when administered solely to females. This review, triggered by the urgent need to address this gap and reduce the associated stigma, aims to evaluate the introduction of a gender-neutral HPV vaccine, GARDASIL-9, in India. The primary objective is to assess the necessity and feasibility of incorporating the gender-neutral HPV vaccine into India's national immunization program. This integration is crucial to ensure equitable access for all children and to mitigate the substantial burden of HPV. A literature search was conducted using databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, government websites, and relevant publications. Keywords included ""gender-neutral vaccine"", ""HPV vaccine"", and ""Indian population"". The central research question guiding this review is: How necessary and feasible is the inclusion of a gender-neutral HPV vaccine in India's national immunization schedule to ensure equitable access for all children and reduce the HPV burden? The review inclusion criteria comprised studies addressing the prevalence of HPV infections, HPV vaccination awareness among both genders, the cost-effectiveness of gender-neutral vaccines, current HPV vaccination status, and future perspectives specific to India. Studies not meeting these criteria were excluded. The review highlights that introducing a gender-neutral HPV vaccine in India is imperative. Including males in vaccination efforts significantly reduces the overall disease burden and helps in reducing the stigma associated with HPV. A comprehensive vaccination program, bolstered by education and awareness campaigns, and its inclusion in the national immunization schedule is essential. This approach ensures equitable access to the vaccine for all children, fostering a healthier community, preventing HPV-related cancers, and enhancing public health outcomes in India.",Vaccination Awareness

Vaccination plays a crucial role in reducing the disease's incidence, mitigating its severity, and limiting transmission, contributing to long-term public health resilience. However, incomplete vaccination coverage and vaccine hesitancy exist. This narrative review investigates strategies at the system and physician levels aimed at sustaining awareness and uptake of COVID-19 vaccination in a post-PHEIC era. Through an examination of the existing literature, this review explores the effectiveness of diverse approaches utilized by healthcare systems and individual providers. These approaches address every component of the 5C model of vaccine hesitancy: confidence, complacency, constraints/convenience, calculation, and collective responsibility. Physician-level approaches include appropriate message framing, persuasive communication containing safety and personal/social benefit information, sharing of personal stories, creating a safe space for discussion, harnessing co-administration with annual influenza vaccines, and use of decision aids and visual messages. System-level approaches include messaging, mass media for health communication, on-site vaccine availability, pharmacist delivery, healthcare protocol integration, incentives, and chatbot use.",Vaccination Awareness

39139368,Young Adult and Parent Willingness to Pay for Meningococcal Serogroup B Vaccination.,"Introduction. Serogroup B (MenB) is the leading cause of invasive meningococcal disease among adolescents and young adults in the United States. The US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends MenB vaccination based on shared clinical decision making between patients and providers. However, suboptimal understanding of these recommendations could contribute to low vaccination awareness and coverage. Understanding young adult and parent expectations of their health care providers (HCPs) and the value they place on vaccine information could help inform a consistent approach to HCP MenB vaccination discussions and recommendations. Methods. Data collected via a discrete-choice experiment online survey were used to evaluate preferences and willingness to pay regarding MenB vaccination among US parents and young adults in 2019. Results. Of 2,388 respondents with valid data, 1,185 were parents of children aged 12 to 25 y, and 1,203 were young adults aged 18 to 25 y. Approximately 70% of parents and young adults indicated that they would react negatively if their HCP chose not to initiate a discussion with them about MenB vaccines. Neither parents nor young adults were willing to pay for additional time for MenB vaccine discussions with their HCP but were willing to pay an average of $416 and $282, respectively, for the vaccine. For parents and young adults, greater willingness to pay was associated with a provaccination attitude and the opinion that the HCP has a moral obligation to discuss the MenB vaccine with them. Conclusion. Both parents and young adults felt their HCP is responsible for initiating a discussion about MenB vaccination and disease risk and were willing to pay for the vaccine. These findings should help inform ACIP recommendations for meningococcal vaccination.",Vaccination Awareness
39044898,Measles Outbreak in Socioeconomically Diverse Sections: A Review.,"Measles outbreaks among socioeconomically weaker sections constitute a significant public health challenge. The objective is to highlight the specific vulnerabilities and contributing factors that make these communities more susceptible to measles outbreaks. Socioeconomically weaker sections, often characterized by poverty, inadequate healthcare access, overcrowding, and suboptimal immunization rates, face heightened risks of measles outbreaks. These outbreaks occur due to various interrelated factors, including limited healthcare infrastructure, low vaccine coverage, a lack of awareness about vaccination benefits, and difficulties in accessing healthcare services. The effects of measles outbreaks in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas are critical. Particularly among vulnerable groups, including newborns, expectant mothers, and malnourished people, measles increases morbidity and mortality. There is also a considerable financial impact on the healthcare system and the afflicted families. Measles outbreaks in these populations must be addressed using a diversified strategy. In order to improve vaccine coverage through targeted immunization programs, raise community vaccination awareness, and address social determinants of health, efforts should concentrate on bolstering the healthcare infrastructure. Effective epidemic control and prevention depend on coordinated efforts by healthcare practitioners, legislators, local leaders, and public health groups. Healthcare systems can lessen the impact of measles in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas and strive toward attaining equitable health outcomes for all populations by addressing the socioeconomic variables that lead to the vulnerability of measles.",Vaccination Awareness

The study aims to analyze the safety profile of HPV4v and HPV9v vaccines and perform a case-by-case review of conditions of interest. Spontaneous reports related to HPV uploaded to the database of the Regional Pharmacovigilance Center between 2008-2022 were included. HPV vaccine doses administered until April 2022 in the Veneto Region were considered to calculate the reporting rate (RR). Potential ""safety concerns"" examined as conditions of interest were included through Standardized MedDRA or preferred terms searching queries. The level of diagnostic certainty was evaluated as per the Brighton Collaboration case definition criteria. A total of 637 reports and 1316 Adverse Events Following Immunizations (AEFI) were retrieved: 469 for HPV4v (73.6 %) and 168 for HPV9v (26.4 %). Serious reports were 71 (11.1 %): 49 (10.4 %) for HPV4v and 22 (13.1 %) for HPV9v. The RR for serious events between 2008-2022 was 6.9/100,000 administered doses, with no differences by vaccine type.

We conducted a cross-sectional, online survey among fathers aged 27 to 45 between March and April 2022, to assess associations between HPV vaccination awareness, behaviors, intentions, and psychosocial constructs from the Health Belief Model. We examined the characteristics of those who had (a) heard of the HPV vaccine, (b) already received ≥ 1 dose, and (c) intentions for future vaccination among those who had never been vaccinated. Among 400 men who completed the survey, 32% were not aware of the HPV vaccine. Among those who were aware, 41% had received ≥ 1 dose. Sixty-three percent of unvaccinated men reported that they intended to get vaccinated in the future. Multivariable logistic regression analyses revealed that age and race/ethnicity were associated with having been vaccinated previously. Among the unvaccinated, multivariable logistic regression analyses revealed that those with a higher perceived risk of HPV-associated cancer had 3.73 greater odds of reporting they would seek vaccination compared to those with lower perceived risk (95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.28, 12.3]). We did not find perceived benefits, barriers, or decision self-efficacy to be related to future vaccine intentions. Since recommendations for this group include shared clinical decision-making, public health efforts should focus on raising awareness of vaccine eligibility, emphasizing risk factors for HPV-associated cancers so that individuals have an accurate perception of risk, and encouraging conversation between men and their providers.",Vaccination Awareness
38872522,A deterministic transmission model for analytics-driven optimization of COVID-19 post-pandemic vaccination and quarantine strategies.,"This study developed a deterministic transmission model for the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), considering various factors such as vaccination, awareness, quarantine, and treatment resource limitations for infected individuals in quarantine facilities. The proposed model comprised five compartments: susceptible, vaccinated, quarantined, infected, and recovery. It also considered awareness and limited resources by using a saturated function. Dynamic analyses, including equilibrium points, control reproduction numbers, and bifurcation analyses, were conducted in this research, employing analytics to derive insights. Our results indicated the possibility of an endemic equilibrium even if the reproduction number for control was less than one. Using incidence data from West Java, Indonesia, we estimated our model parameter values to calibrate them with the real situation in the field. Elasticity analysis highlighted the crucial role of contact restrictions in reducing the spread of COVID-19, especially when combined with community awareness. This emphasized the analytics-driven nature of our approach. We transformed our model into an optimal control framework due to budget constraints. Leveraging Pontriagin's maximum principle, we meticulously formulated and solved our optimal control problem using the forward-backward sweep method. Our experiments underscored the pivotal role of vaccination in infection containment. Vaccination effectively reduces the risk of infection among vaccinated individuals, leading to a lower overall infection rate. However, combining vaccination and quarantine measures yields even more promising results than vaccination alone. A second crucial finding emphasized the need for early intervention during outbreaks rather than delayed responses. Early interventions significantly reduce the number of preventable infections, underscoring their importance.",Vaccination Awareness

38793804,Confronting Inequalities and Bridging the Divide: A Retrospective Study Assessment of Country-Level COVID-19 Vaccine Equality with a Cox Regression Model.,"COVID-19 vaccination is vital in reducing illness, hospitalization, and mortality in the face of this global pandemic. However, COVID-19 vaccination rates worldwide remain below WHO public health targets, and persistent structural inequities reduce vaccine uptake likelihood among populations of low socioeconomic status. We conducted a cross-sectional study based on publicly available data from the Our World in Data project. We included all 124 countries with available open epidemic data and a population of more than 5 million. We used a Cox Regression Model, with population, population density, median age, human development index, GDP per capita, gender inequality index, healthcare access and quality index, hospital beds per thousand people, completion rate of primary education, infection cases of COVID-19 by the end of 2022, and death rate due to COVID-19 by the end of 2022 as predictors for model hazard rates of completion of 50% population vaccination. According to our study, countries with higher populations, higher population density, higher human development index, lower gender inequality index, and lower hospital beds per 1000 people had a higher hazard rate, which means they were more likely to achieve 50% population vaccination faster. By utilizing the time to achieve vaccination rate goals as our primary endpoint, we evaluated inequity from a dual perspective, considering both the differences in vaccination rates and the duration required to attain them. Consequently, this study employed survival analysis approaches to gain a comprehensive understanding of vaccine drivers and population-level trends nationally and inform all communities from a statistical perspective to prepare for health emergencies. Development-level standing modified the effects of equal access to COVID-19 vaccination on cumulative cases and mortality, for which countries of low or medium human development tended to fare worse in outcomes than high human development countries. As COVID-19 vaccination efforts evolve, healthcare professionals, scholars, and policymakers need to identify the structural impediments to equitable vaccination awareness, access, and uptake so that future vaccination campaigns are not impeded by these barriers to immunization. Recognizing the complex nature of this significant barrier, it is evident that no single statistical analysis method can comprehensively address all intricacies.",Vaccination Awareness

Twenty colleges/universities have a health center with 11 providing the HPV vaccine on campus: most are large public universities and non-religious private colleges. A few religious private universities and one community college offer the vaccine on campus. More than half (n = 26) of Oregon colleges/universities had a webpage specifically designated for immunization information, but only 11 mentioned the HPV vaccine on their immunization webpage. Twelve colleges/universities recommend, and none require the vaccine. Information on HPV vaccination services and education was limited on college/university websites, especially on community college and religious private university websites.

38133265,"Epidemiology, Molecular Pathogenesis, Immuno-Pathogenesis, Immune Escape Mechanisms and Vaccine Evaluation for HPV-Associated Carcinogenesis.","Human papillomavirus (HPV) is implicated in over 90% of cervical cancer cases, with factors like regional variability, HPV genotype, the population studied, HPV vaccination status, and anatomical sample collection location influencing the prevalence and pathology of HPV-induced cancer. HPV-16 and -18 are mainly responsible for the progression of several cancers, including cervix, anus, vagina, penis, vulva, and oropharynx. The oncogenic ability of HPV is not only sufficient for the progression of malignancy, but also for other tumor-generating steps required for the production of invasive cancer, such as coinfection with other viruses, lifestyle factors such as high parity, smoking, tobacco chewing, use of contraceptives for a long time, and immune responses such as stimulation of chronic stromal inflammation and immune deviation in the tumor microenvironment. Viral evasion from immunosurveillance also supports viral persistence, and virus-like particle-based prophylactic vaccines have been licensed, which are effective against high-risk HPV types. In addition, vaccination awareness programs and preventive strategies could help reduce the rate and incidence of HPV infection. In this review, we emphasize HPV infection and its role in cancer progression, molecular and immunopathogenesis, host immune response, immune evasion by HPV, vaccination, and preventive schemes battling HPV infection and HPV-related cancers.",Vaccination Awareness

We analyzed the nationally representative data from the Health Information National Trends Survey of US adults 18 years or older (n = 16,092) administered by the National Cancer Institute (HINTS5-Cycle 1,2,3,4) for the years 2017-2020, of which 2,011 (n = 2,011) were non-Hispanic Black adults. Weighted Poisson regression models were used to estimate disparities in HPV and HPV vaccination awareness among non-Hispanic Black US adults. In the US, 63.2% of non-Hispanic Black adults had heard of HPV and 57.6% were aware of the HPV vaccine. Black females had 1.3 and 1.5 times the prevalence of HPV and the HPV vaccine awareness compared to males (PR = 1.3; 95% CI = 1.2-1.4; P ≤ 0.001) and (PR = 1.5; 95% CI = 1.4-1.6; P ≤ 0.001) respectively.

Health inequity within ethnic minorities has been explained by factors such as higher prevalence of underlying disease, restricted access to care, and lower vaccination rates. In this study, we investigated the effect of cultural tailoring of communicators and media outlets, respectively, on vaccine willingness in an influenza vaccination campaign in the Netherlands. A total of 1226 participants were recruited from two culturally non-tailored media outlets (Dutch newspaper and Facebook), and one media outlet tailored to a large community in the Netherlands with Indian ancestry. The participants from all three media outlets were randomly exposed to a vaccination awareness video delivered by a physician with an Indian or Dutch background, followed by an online survey. Cultural tailoring compared to cultural non-tailoring of communicators showed no difference in improvement of vaccine willingness (13.9% vs. 20.7% increment, respectively, p = 0.083). However, the media outlet tailored to the community with Indian ancestry, resulted in a higher improvement of vaccine willingness compared to non-tailored media outlets (46.7% vs. 14.7% increment, respectively, p < 0.001, unadjusted OR = 5.096).

A total of 290 people who were vaccinated against COVID-19 at the Samsun Training and Research Hospital between 16 April 2021 and 16 April 2022 and volunteered to participate in the study were included. The questionnaire form was created by the researchers. According to the national and global guidelines, the seasonal influenza vaccine, Td or Tdap vaccines (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis), shingles vaccine, and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV15 or PCV20), have been recommended to all adults over the age of 65. It was questioned whether the participants had the vaccines recommended for them before and after the pandemic, if they were not vaccinated, what were the reasons, and whether the COVID-19 pandemic affected the general view on vaccination in this age group. Demographic data and comorbidities were also recorded. After each response that showed that the participant was not vaccinated, reasons were investigated with new questions to find out the causes of vaccine refusal or vaccine hesitancy. Finally, all participants were asked whether they would have the relevant vaccinations when offered. It was shown that 282 (94.3%) of the 299 people who participated in the study were considering getting a regular COVID-19 vaccine from now on, while 84.3% of the participants mentioned that the COVID-19 pandemic had a positive effect on their general vaccination behaviour. While 39 (13%) people stated that their view on vaccination was not affected by the pandemic, 8 (2.7%) people stated that it was negatively affected. The most common reason about low vaccination rates before the pandemic was a lack of enough knowledge about the recommended vaccines. The pandemic increased the vaccination awareness among the adult population. We think that vaccination rates may be improved by education of the geriatric population on this subject.",Vaccination Awareness
36560423,Beliefs and Sociodemographic and Occupational Factors Associated with Vaccine Hesitancy among Health Workers.,"Introduction: Vaccine hesitancy has been implicated in the low-vaccination coverage in several countries. Knowledge about vaccine hesitancy predictors in health workers is essential because they play a central role in communication about the importance and safety of vaccines. This study aimed to assess beliefs and sociodemographic and occupational factors associated with vaccine hesitancy in health workers. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study among 453 health workers in primary and medium complexity services in a municipality in the state of Bahia, Brazil. The variable vaccine hesitancy was operationalized based on the answers related to incomplete vaccination against hepatitis B, measles, mumps and rubella, and diphtheria and tetanus. Associations between variables were expressed as prevalence ratios (PR) and their respective 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Endemic disease combat agents, administrative service workers, and support staff had the highest levels of vaccine hesitancy. Among the analyzed variables, the following were associated with vaccine hesitancy: working in secondary health care services (PR: 1.21; CI: 1.07-1.36), working as an endemic disease combat agent (PR = 1.42; 95% CI: 1.165-1.75), not sharing information about vaccines on social media (PR = 1.16; 95% CI: 1.05-1.28), distrusting information about vaccinations (PR: 0.86; CI: 0.75-0.99), and not feeling safe receiving new vaccines (PR = 1.16; 95% CI: 1.06-1.28). Conclusions: Strategies to enhance confidence in vaccination among health workers should consider differences in occupations and their working settings. Improving vaccination-related content in training and continuing education activities and facilitating access to onsite vaccinations at the workplace are crucial elements to reduce vaccine hesitancy among health workers.",Vaccination Awareness

Since then, despite widespread recommendations to prevent the spread of the disease and provide treatment for sick people, 6,573,968 people died all over the world, 101,203 of which in Turkey. According to the international adult vaccination guidelines, pregnant women have been recommended to get vaccinated against the new coronavirus disease, as well as influenza and tetanus, during pregnancy. Before this study, not enough information was available about the vaccination awareness and vaccination hesitancy rates of pregnant women living in Turkey. For this reason, we believe that our study will contribute to filling this gap in the literature. The main objective of this study was to investigate the vaccination rates of pregnant women in a local hospital in Turkey and the reasons for vaccine hesitancy in this patient group. The minimum sample size of the study was found to be 241, with 80% power, 0.2 effect size, and 95% confidence interval, at p < 0.05 significance level. We included 247 consecutive pregnant women who applied to the Samsun Training and Research Hospital Gynecology and Obstetrics Outpatient Clinics between January 2022 and April 2022. The researchers prepared a questionnaire by taking into account the characteristics of the local community. A preliminary survey with these questions was also conducted before starting the main study. The mean age of the pregnant women participating in the study was 28.7 ± 5.3 years, and the mean gestational age was 28.2 ± 7.9 weeks. Among the participants, 26.3% were university graduates or had a higher degree, and 17% were actively working; in addition, 93 (37.7%) of the 247 pregnant women had received the COVID-19 vaccine, 203 (82.2%) had received at least one dose of the tetanus vaccine, and only 1 (0.4%) person had been administered the influenza vaccine during pregnancy. The most common reason for COVID-19 vaccine refusal and hesitancy was safety concerns, while the low rates of tetanus and influenza vaccination were due to a lack of knowledge. These results show that it is important to inform and educate the pregnant population on this subject to improve their vaccination behavior.",Vaccination Awareness
36293745,"Disease Progression, Clinical Features, and Risk Factors for Pneumonia in Unvaccinated Children and Adolescents with Measles: A Re-Emerging Disease in Romania.","Measles causes in vaccinated children, with some exceptions, a mild disease, while the unvaccinated can suffer complications that result in serious consequences and even death. Although the introduction of the measles vaccine has reduced the number of cases and the viral spread, the current downward vaccination trend has resulted in the resurgence of the disease. Currently, Romania has a measles vaccination coverage below the 95% safety threshold. Thus, an outbreak started in 2016 and still ongoing in Romania, many cases being identified in the Western region in the pediatric population. Our objective was to conduct a thorough examination of clinical characteristics, evolution, and risk factors in vaccinated and unvaccinated children in this region. To reach our objectives we used a retrospective cohort analysis. The authors reviewed clinical and laboratory data from patients hospitalized at ""Victor Babes"" Hospital for Infectious Diseases and Pulmonology in Timisoara. We found a total of 136 qualifying cases of measles among the children admitted to this facility. The two comparison groups consisted of 104 children under 10 years and 32 patients between 10 and 18 years. An important characteristic of both study groups was the high prevalence of patients from the Roma ethnicity, which, although represents a minority in Romania, the prevalence was over 40% in the current study. The infection source was in 40.4% of children under 10 years inside the family, while 71.9% of infections in the group of adolescents were isolated (p-value = 0.047). The multivariate risk factor analysis identified as independent risk factors for the development of pneumonia the older age of patients (OR = 1.62), poor nutritional status (OR = 1.25), Roma ethnicity (OR = 2.44), presence of anemia (OR = 1.58), and procalcitonin (OR = 3.09). It is essential to handle these risk factors in a patient with measles, especially in conjunction with an unknown vaccination status. To achieve a vaccination rate greater than 95 percent for Romanian children, measles vaccination awareness must be promoted, moreover in the Roma population. More comprehensive preventative methods must be developed promptly with the objective of eradicating measles in Romania via a vigorous vaccination campaign.",Vaccination Awareness

36145449,Biological Profile and Clinical Features as Determinants for Prolonged Hospitalization in Adult Patients with Measles: A Monocentric Study in Western Romania.,"Measles is a highly infectious and sometimes deadly illness that is preventable with vaccination. The present research aims to analyze the most recent measles epidemic from Romania that occurred in a population with a falling desire to receive immunizations, by detailing the clinical picture and biological profile of hospitalized patients. A secondary goal of the present research is to identify characteristics that increase the likelihood of a longer hospitalization and the development of measles-related pneumonia. A retrospective cohort study was conducted to follow the course and effects of measles virus infection in adult hospitalized patients who were divided into two groups based on whether they had been in the hospital for more than 6 days or fewer than 6 days. A total of 114 adult patients with measles were eligible to participate in the trial if they had a positive measles-specific IgM antibody test resulting from the study. The average age in the short hospital stay group was 28.1 years, while the average age in the long hospital stay group was 31.9 years. There was a statistically significant difference in the number of Roma persons in the research groups, with 17.4 percent of them having a lengthy hospital stay compared to 5.9 percent in the group with a short hospital stay, according to the findings. It was observed that many patients had a long hospitalization associated with chronic lung disease (OR = 1.07), liver damage (OR = 1.66), Roma ethnicity (OR = 1.79), a long duration elapsed from the last MMR dose (OR = 2.02), elevated c-reactive protein (OR = 2.17), the presence of bilateral pulmonary condensations on X-ray (OR = 3.13), and elevated procalcitonin (OR = 3.49). The same significant independent risk factors were also associated with the development of pneumonia. It is of imperative need to address these risk factors in a patient with measles, moreover in association with an unknown status of vaccination. Vaccination awareness against measles must be pushed in Romania to determine a higher than 95% coverage. Significant efforts are still needed to ensure improved protection against measles epidemics within a specific region or population and, more importantly, in patients with significant risk factors for complications, as described in this study.",Vaccination Awareness

The HPV vaccination has been widely advocated around the world since the vaccine is beneficial in avoiding diseases, including some sexually transmitted diseases, brought on by HPV infections. For most Chinese, the HPV vaccine is still a relatively new concept, having only been made available to the general public in 2016. Despite the vaccine's increased prominence, there is still a lack of investigation about how the public is influencing the conversation about HPV vaccines and the public's perception of this vaccine. With the theoretical construct of the Health Belief Model, this study conducts both quantitative and qualitative content analysis to investigate the existing media narratives around HPV vaccines in China and the changes in public opinion by looking at users' contributions on Weibo, one of China's most popular social networking sites. It was found that different groups of Weibo users had contributed to diverse narratives surrounding HPV vaccination. Though the public awareness of HPV vaccination had been improved along with increasingly active communication practices and enhanced public health services, public knowledge about HPV remains inadequate. Therefore, to facilitate the popularisation of HPV related knowledge, more effort should be invested in tailoring and disseminating messages that communicate responsive and comprehensive HPV related information.",Vaccination Awareness

The questionnaire collected information on demographic data, knowledge about respiratory tract disease vaccines, and hesitancy about vaccines. Results. Four hundred twenty-four patients (female = 256, male = 168) enrolled in the study. In this study, 148 (34.9%) participants were vaccinated against pneumonia, 155 (36.6%) against flu, and 312 (73.6%) against COVID-19. In addition, antivaccination sentiment was recorded in 8.7% of patients with diabetes. We found that participants in the study primarily rely on doctors as the source of information about vaccines (doctor (46.7%), nurse (1.2%), television (8.7%), friend/neighbour (8.7%), and others (2.6%)). The rate of vaccination was statistically higher than the presence of comorbid diseases. Conclusions. We examined the vaccine awareness of patients with diabetes and investigated factors affecting it. İt was determined that vaccination awareness is affected by many factors, especially comorbid diseases and educational status. The study showed that patients primarily relied on doctors as their source of information for vaccination.

35844850,Trends in Adult and Elderly Vaccination: Focus on Vaccination Practices in Tunisia and Morocco.,"Vaccine preventable diseases (VPDs) are a prevailing concern among the adult population, despite availability of vaccines. Unlike pediatric vaccination programs, adult vaccination programs lack the required reach, initiative, and awareness. Clinical studies and real-world data have proven that vaccines effectively reduce the disease burden of VPDs and increase life expectancy. In Tunisia and Morocco, the national immunization program (NIP) focuses more on pediatric vaccination and have limited vaccination programs for adults. However, some vaccination campaigns targeting adults are organized. For example, influenza vaccination campaigns prioritizing at risk adults which includes healthcare professionals, elderly, and patients with comorbidities. Women of childbearing age who have never been vaccinated or whose information is uncertain are recommended to receive tetanus vaccination. Tunisia NIP recommends rubella vaccine mainly for women of childbearing age, while in Morocco, national vaccination campaigns were organized for girls and women (up to 24 years of age) to eliminate rubella. Further, travelers from both countries are recommended to follow all requirements and recommendations in the travel destination. The objective of this manuscript is to provide an overview of the global disease burden of common VPDs including (but not limited to) meningococcal diseases, pneumococcal diseases, hepatitis, and influenza. The review also provides an overview of clinical data and guidelines/recommendations on adult vaccination practices, with special focus on Tunisia and Morocco. Some European and North American countries have concrete recommendations and strategies for adult vaccination to keep the VPDs in check. In Morocco and Tunisia, although, there are sporadic adult vaccination initiatives, the efforts still need upscaling and endorsements to boost vaccination awareness and uptake. There is a need to strengthen strategies in both countries to understand the disease burden and spread awareness.

35695750,Sex and educational attainment differences in HPV knowledge and vaccination awareness among unvaccinated-sexually active adults in Puerto Rico.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) knowledge and HPV vaccination uptake remain suboptimal. We assessed sex and educational attainment differences in HPV knowledge and vaccine awareness. Data from a cross-sectional study (2018-2021) in Puerto Rico among adults aged 21-49 was analyzed (n = 278). Adequate knowledge was defined as a score of ≥70% of correct responses on a 13-item knowledge scale. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the association of sex (men vs. women) and education (high school or less vs. more than high school) categories with adequate HPV knowledge and vaccine awareness. Adequate HPV knowledge was higher among women (53%) and men (46%) with more than high school and was lower among women (46%) and men (27%) with high school or less. For HPV vaccine awareness, similar results were observed. Women (OR = 3.0 ; 95%CI = 1.4-6.2) and men (OR = 2.3 , 95%CI = 1.1-4.8) with more than high school and women with high school or less (OR = 2.3 , 95%CI = 1.0-5.2) were more likely to have adequate HPV vaccine knowledge than men with high-school or less education. Heightened HPV vaccine awareness was also seen among more educated women and men and women with similar lower education when compared to men with ≤ high school. Men and individuals with lower educational attainment were more likely to have inadequate HPV knowledge and vaccine awareness. HPV vaccine-oriented educational interventions should target these high-risk groups.",Vaccination Awareness
35335083,COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy among Adolescents: Cross-Sectional School Survey in Four Chinese Cities Prior to Vaccine Availability.,"To address the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, development and regulatory evaluations have been accelerated for vaccines, authorizing emergency use. To anticipate vaccine preparedness in adolescents, we studied COVID-19 vaccination awareness and willingness to vaccinate before the vaccine became available. We conducted a cross-sectional survey among 9153 (4575 boys, 50%) students with a mean age of 14.2 years old in four cities in China to collect information on demographic characteristics and their COVID-19 vaccination concerns. Multinomial logistic regression was used to analyze the influencing factors of vaccine hesitancy (""not sure"") and resistance (""do not want it""). The results showed that 2891 (31.6%) were hesitant and 765 (8.4%) were resistant to being vaccinated. Additionally, multivariable analyses showed that vaccine hesitancy and vaccine resistance were associated with living in the Beijing area (OR = 1.62; 95% CI: 1.40-1.88; OR = 1.81; 95% CI: 1.44-2.28), lack of influenza vaccination experience (OR = 1.33; 95% CI: 1.14-1.55; OR = 1.57; 95% CI: 1.25-1.98), no perceived susceptibility (OR = 1.72; 95% CI: 1.50-1.97; OR = 3.57; 95% CI: 2.86-4.46), and perceiving no cues to action (OR = 3.24; 95% CI: 2.56-4.11; OR = 27.68; 95% CI: 21.81-35.13). Postulating a highly effective vaccine (OR = 0.84; 95% CI: 0.72-0.98; OR = 0.66; 95% CI: 0.52-0.83) decreased both vaccine hesitancy and resistance. Vaccine hesitancy alone was associated with girls (OR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.09-1.36) and was less common among students boarding at school (OR = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.68-0.92), postulating convenient vaccine access (OR = 0.84; 95% CI: 0.73-0.96), and having doctors' recommendation (OR = 0.86; 95% CI: 0.76-0.98). In conclusion, the results of the study showed that vaccine hesitancy among students in China was associated with limited health literacy and lower risk awareness. Our findings in China suggest that educating youth regarding COVID-19 and the safety and effectiveness of immunization help reduce concerns and increase vaccine confidence and acceptance.",Vaccination Awareness

Participants belonged to the Communities, Households, and SARS-CoV-2 Epidemiology COVID (CHASING COVID) Cohort, a national longitudinal study. Trends and correlates of vaccine hesitancy were examined longitudinally in 8 interview rounds from October 2020 to July 2021. We also estimated the association between willingness to vaccinate and subsequent vaccine uptake through July 2021. Vaccine delay and refusal decreased from 51% and 8% in October 2020 to 8% and 6% in July 2021, respectively. Compared with non-Hispanic (NH) White participants, NH Black and Hispanic participants had higher adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for both vaccine delay (for NH Black, aOR = 2.0 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.5, 2.7), and for Hispanic, 1.3 (95% CI: 1.0, 1.7)) and vaccine refusal (for NH Black, aOR = 2.5 (95% CI: 1.8, 3.6), and for Hispanic, 1.4 (95% CI: 1.0, 2.0)) in June 2021. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, compared with vaccine-willingness, was associated with lower odds of subsequent vaccine uptake (for vaccine delayers, aOR = 0.15, 95% CI: 0.13, 0.18; for vaccine refusers, aOR = 0.02; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.03 ), adjusted for sociodemographic factors and COVID-19 history.

34920693,Factors associated with intention of human papillomavirus vaccination among Chinese college students: implications for health promotion.,"Human papilloma virus (HPV) is the most common reproductive tract virus. Most HPV infections occur during adolescence or young adulthood, and thus college students are one of the main target populations of HPV vaccination. However, data on knowledge of HPV and HPV vaccine as well as the intention to be vaccinated among Chinese college students were limited. The purpose of this study was to address this gap by investigating a sample of college students from four universities and analyzing the factors influencing their intention. College students (N = 343) filled in a survey comprised of demographic information, HPV and vaccine knowledge, and vaccination intention between September 2018 and January 2019. A descriptive statistical analysis was conducted to describe students' HPV-related knowledge and vaccination intention. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the predictors of HPV vaccination intention. The participants had low levels of HPV and HPV vaccine-related knowledge, as well as modest intention to be vaccinated. Significant differences were identified in gender, years of study, and perceived susceptibility of HPV infection. Students who perceived higher risk of HPV infection (OR = 6.659, p = .001), had higher level knowledge of HPV vaccine (OR = 2.697, p < .001), in junior (OR = 0.186, p = .006) and senior year (OR = 0.276, p = .015) had greater intention to get HPV vaccinated. The findings suggest that multiple-level efforts are continuously needed to target Chinese college students to increase their HPV vaccine knowledge and vaccination awareness to reduce HPV-related disease burden among this population.",Vaccination Awareness

Educators are key to preventing the spread of COVID-19 in educational settings. Infection prevention behavior requires comprehensive and complex measures such as self-restraint. disinfection care, hand washing, wearing masks and recommendation and implementation of vaccination. Improvement in the knowledge, skills, and preventive actions of educators vis-à-vis COVID-19 could allow for the continued provision of educational services while ensuring safety in educational settings. Therefore, the objective of this study was to explore the knowledge and preventive actions of educators regarding COVID-19 and vaccination awareness to provide appropriate support for educators. The study used data collected from 1,000 Japanese educators in January 2021 when the third wave of viral infections spread. Online surveys and multivariate linear regression analysis were used to determine age and whether respondents were being cared for by a doctor. We investigated the effects of factors on educators' willingness to be vaccinated and changes in their behavior. This study found that factors such as age, gender, whether a respondent was under a physician's care, and health literacy, affected the willingness of educators to receive vaccinations and engage in preventive actions. The study also suggests that the reliability of national government public relations efforts is lower than the reliability of local government public relations and that of information from family physicians, pharmacies, and mass media. It is therefore necessary to reexamine how information is disseminated by the national government and to increase the degree of trust in that information among the public. The findings of the study also revealed the importance of improving the provision of appropriate information and health literacy for the behavior of educators, not only during the initial outbreak, but also during the subsequent period of pandemic life.",Vaccination Awareness

No nationally based studies have examined the relationship between nativity with HPV and HPV vaccination awareness and knowledge, especially examining acculturation, an immigration-specific process affecting health-related behaviors. We assessed nativity differences in HPV awareness and knowledge, and awareness of HPV vaccination using data from a population-based sample of adults in the U.S. (n = 2415). Among foreign-born respondents, we also assessed the association of acculturation with outcomes. Awareness of HPV and HPV vaccination were lower among foreign-born respondents compared to U.S.-born respondents. Knowledge of HPV was similar between populations.

34125424,Vaccination in Older Adults: An Underutilized Opportunity to Promote Healthy Aging in India.,"Over the last 50 years, the Indian population aged 50 years and above (older adults) has quadrupled and is expected to comprise 404 million people in 2036, representing 27% of the country's projected population. Consequently, the contribution of chronic disease to older adults' total burden of diseases in India is likely to escalate. Disease burden is notably amplified by immunosenescence, a deterioration of the immune system that develops with age, leading to increasing susceptibility to infectious diseases and other comorbidities. Older adults with infectious diseases have a higher incidence and likelihood of life-threatening comorbidities such as coronary artery disease, arrhythmia, stroke, myocardial infarction, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. Therefore, immunization of older adults through vaccination might greatly reduce the burden imposed by vaccine preventable infectious diseases in this population. Here, we review evidence relevant to the disease burden among adults aged ≥ 50 years in India, and existing vaccination recommendations. Furthermore, we suggest a set of routine vaccinations for healthy older adults in India. There is a clear mandate to recognize the contributions of older adults to society and embrace strategies promoting healthy aging, which is described by the World Health Organization as the process of developing and maintaining functional ability and well-being in older age. Increasing vaccination awareness and coverage among older adults is an important step in that direction for India.",Vaccination Awareness

34035566,Is it the Right Time to Introduce the Hepatitis B Booster Vaccine in National Immunization Schedule? An Analysis from the Available Evidence.,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global health concern, and it is considered one of the deadliest infections in the world, having nearly 1.2 million deaths annually. Around 75% of all global HBV carriers live in the Asia-Pacific region. In this regard, India has a prevalence ranging between 2% and 7% with exposure rates of 10%-60%. Hepatitis B is a vaccine-preventable disease. In India, the World Health Organization protocol for hepatitis B vaccination has been followed, and it is given free of cost in public health facilities under the National Immunization Schedule. Despite the free hepatitis vaccination program in India, coverage and awareness are low. Low awareness, followed by low coverage of hepatitis vaccination, can prove dangerous for the Indian population in the long run. A majority of chronic hepatitis cases progress silently to end-stage liver disease without having many signs and symptoms. Once occurred, a complete cure is not possible with currently available drugs. The studies from neighboring countries such as China and Taiwan documented that the impact of single-dose booster for children of 10 years has made a significant difference from the cost-effectiveness perspective. They have also included the booster dose in their national vaccination program. Considering the low level of vaccination awareness, small coverage, high disease burden, and high treatment cost, now, it is high time for India to introduce hepatitis B booster vaccine.",Vaccination Awareness
33860541,A systematic review of human papillomavirus vaccination among US adolescents.,"The human papillomavirus (HPV) causes many anogenital and oral cancers affecting young adults in the United States. Vaccination during adolescence can prevent HPV-associated cancers, but vaccine uptake among adolescents is low and influenced by factors serving as barriers and facilitators to HPV vaccination. In this systematic review, we synthesized research using the socioecological framework model to examine individual-level, relationship-level, community-level, and societal-level factors that influence HPV vaccine initiation and completion among US adolescents. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were used to guide the methodology for this review. An electronic search was conducted in January 2020 using PubMed, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, ProQuest Central, Scopus, and American Psychological Association PsycInfo databases. The Joanna Briggs Institute tools were used to assess the quality for the 57 studies included in this review. The most consistent influences of HPV vaccination included age at vaccination, awareness, and knowledge about HPV vaccination, socioeconomic status, insurance status, race/ethnicity, and preventative care behaviors at the individual level. Provider recommendation, familial/peer support of vaccination, and parental health behaviors were influences at the relationship level. Although fewer findings elucidated community-level and societal-level influences, high-poverty areas, high-risk communities with large proportions of racial/ethnic minority groups, healthcare facilities servicing children, and combined health policies appear to serve as facilitators of HPV initiation and completion. Findings from this review can inform culturally relevant and age-specific interventions and multi-level policies aiming to improve HPV vaccination coverage in the United States.",Vaccination Awareness

Understanding OB/GYNs' human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination practices, including knowledge of and barriers to vaccination, is essential to design effective interventions to increase vaccination. This study evaluated OB/GYN knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs regarding vaccinating both younger (18-26 years) and mid-adult (27-45 years) women. Materials and Methods: Data were collected from OB/GYN providers in October 2019 through a nationwide web-based survey. Items included the following: HPV-related vaccination practices, recommendation strength, knowledge (seven items), benefits (four items), and barriers (eight items). Results: The sample (n = 224) was majority were White (69%), men (56%), and practice in suburban clinics (55%). Most (84%) reported they usually or always recommend HPV vaccine to eligible patients, but estimated only about half (51%) of other OB/GYNs did the same. Recommendation strength varied by patient age with 84% strongly recommending it to patients ≤18 years, compared with 79% and 25% strongly recommending to younger and mid-adult patients, respectively (p < 0.01). Participants reported lower benefits (p = 0.007) and higher barriers (p < 0.001) for 27- to 45-year-old patients compared with younger patients. Cost was the most frequently reported barrier, regardless of patient age. Overall knowledge was high (m = 5.2/7) but 33% of participants did not know the vaccine was safe while breastfeeding. Conclusions: Although providers reported strongly and consistently recommending the HPV vaccination to their adult patients, there were gaps in knowledge and attitudinal barriers that need to be addressed.

Its current status in South East Nigeria with respect to its prevalence and farmers' awareness was studied. Three states, Anambra, Ebonyi, and Enugu, were randomly selected for the study. Sera samples from 113 goats and 172 sheep (collected from December 2017 to June 2018) were randomly collected and analysed for the presence of PPRV antibodies, while structured interview schedules were conducted to elicit information on farmers' awareness of the disease and PPR vaccination and use of veterinary services. An overall seroprevalence of 42.5% (121/285) was recorded. The seroprevalence in decreasing order was 62.2% (Enugu), 34.8% (Anambra) and 20.3% (Ebonyi). There was a significant association (X2 = 36.08, df = 2, p = 0.0001) between seroprevalence and the state sampled. Lack of awareness of PPR vaccination among small ruminant farmers, their limited use of veterinary services (38% consult veterinarians) and non-availability of the vaccine at veterinary establishments in the sampled states are potential risk factors of PPR prevalence in South East Nigeria. Consequently, an effective control measure like mass vaccination is recommended for the study area. Also, there is a need for an extension program for stakeholders and farmers in the study area and country on the grave importance and economic benefits of PPR vaccination and the use of veterinary services.",Vaccination Awareness
