    "#### Step 3: Simulating Realistic HCP–Campaign Interactions and Engagement Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, **synthetic interaction dataset** is created that mimics how healthcare professionals (HCPs) engage with scientific content campaigns across multiple channels.\n",
    "Each record represents a single **HCP–campaign interaction event** enriched with behavioral, temporal, and contextual features.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Iterating through HCPs and Selecting Campaigns**\n",
    "\n",
    "    For every HCP in the master dataset, a subset of campaigns that match their medical specialty is identified.\n",
    "    If no match exists, content is sampled from all available campaigns to maintain diversity.\n",
    "    Each HCP interacts with a **random number of campaigns (5–12)** — replicating natural variability in content exposure frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Statistically, this process defines a **conditional sampling mechanism**:\n",
    "\n",
    "                    P(content∣HCP specialty) > P(content)\n",
    "                    \n",
    "    reflecting that HCPs are more likely to receive and interact with content aligned with their clinical expertise.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Simulating Temporal Engagement Patterns**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Each interaction is assigned a timestamp over the **past 90 days**, distributed across hours of the day based on **realistic engagement probabilities**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Morning and evening peaks (9–11 AM, 3–7 PM)\n",
    "    - Lower engagement around lunchtime and late evening\n",
    "\n",
    "    This yields a **non-uniform temporal distribution** that captures real-world attention rhythms — crucial for time-aware models such as **sequence-based recommenders** or **temporal decay analysis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Modeling Engagement Likelihood**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Simulating engagement behavior using probabilistic rules based on specialty relevance:\n",
    "    - **65%** chance of engagement when content matches the HCP’s specialty\n",
    "    - **25%** otherwise\n",
    "\n",
    "    If engaged, an HCP produces measurable interaction metrics:\n",
    "    - **Clicks**: Random count (1–3) indicating active interaction\n",
    "    - **Dwell Time**: Random duration (20–180 seconds) representing reading or viewing time\n",
    "    - **Conversion**: Binary indicator (10% conditional probability) signifying a high-value action such as form submission or follow-up request\n",
    "\n",
    "    This probabilistic framework captures the **stochastic nature of user engagement** and the **domain relevance effect**, which are essential components in modeling **propensity-to-engage**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Computing Engagement Score and Label**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Each interaction is transformed into quantifiable outcomes through a weighted engagement score:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Score = 0.4(Clicks) + 0.3log(1 + Dwell Time) + 0.3(Conversion)\n",
    "        \n",
    "    This formula balances **activity (clicks), attention duration (dwell time),** and **conversion intent** — providing a continuous measure of engagement strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A **binary engagement label** is also created:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - 1 if there was any meaningful activity (clicks, long dwell time, or conversion).\n",
    "    - 0 if the content was ignored.\n",
    "    which simplifies behavioral outcomes for downstream **classification tasks** such as predicting whether an HCP will engage with a given campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "*The result is a realistic, multi-dimensional dataset representing HCP–campaign interactions over time. It reflects real-world dynamics such as*:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Specialty-driven content targeting\n",
    "- Daily engagement patterns\n",
    "- Variable behavioral intensity\n",
    "\n",
