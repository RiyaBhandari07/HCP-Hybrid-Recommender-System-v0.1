## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

The **HCP Hybrid Recommender System v0.1** is a **data science-driven healthcare marketing recommendation engine** that predicts **Next Best Content (NBC)** and **Next Best Channel (NBC)** for Healthcare Professionals (HCPs).

By combining **Deep Learning (LSTM)**, **Topic Modeling (NLP)**, and **Collaborative + Content-Based Filtering**, this system generates **personalized engagement recommendations** â€” empowering pharmaceutical marketing teams to optimize digital outreach strategies.

It represents a **complete end-to-end pipeline** â€” from **data ingestion and feature engineering** to **model training, evaluation**, and **deployment through a Streamlit dashboard**.
