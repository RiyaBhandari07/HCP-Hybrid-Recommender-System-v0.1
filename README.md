## Project Overview

The **HCP Hybrid Recommender System (v0.1)** is a **data-driven healthcare marketing engine** designed to recommend the **Next Best Content (NBC)** and **Next Best Channel (NBC)** for Healthcare Professionals (HCPs).  

The system integrates **Deep Learning (LSTM)**, **Topic Modeling (NLP)**, and **Collaborative + Content-Based Filtering** to generate **personalized, context-aware recommendations**.  
It represents a **complete end-to-end pipeline** ‚Äî from **data ingestion, preprocessing, and model training** to **deployment through a Streamlit dashboard**.

## Purpose

Pharmaceutical companies engage with thousands of HCPs across multiple channels ‚Äî email campaigns, webinars, and scientific content distribution.  
Determining the **most relevant content**, **optimal delivery channel**, and **right timing** for each HCP is a persistent challenge.

This project aims to:

- Build a **hybrid recommender system** that integrates behavioral, textual, and contextual data.
- Predict the **Next Best Content (NBC)** and **Next Best Channel (NBC)** to drive meaningful engagement.
- Demonstrate a **scalable, interpretable deep learning framework** for healthcare marketing personalization.

## Deep Learning for HCP Recommendation

The core of the system is a **Hybrid LSTM Model** that fuses three complementary components:

| Component | Methodology | Description |
|------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Sequential Modeling** | Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) | Learns temporal patterns in HCP‚Äìcontent engagement |
| **Scientific Content Understanding** | Topic Modeling (LDA) | Represents PubMed abstracts in topic space |
| **Collaborative Filtering** | Matrix-based scoring | Captures peer-level engagement similarity among HCPs |

This integrated architecture enables **personalized, explainable, and data-rich recommendations** by combining temporal, semantic, and behavioral learning.

## Tools & Technologies

| Category | Tools/Frameworks |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Programming Languages** | Python 3.11, SQL |
| **Machine Learning** | Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras |
| **NLP & Topic Modeling** | spaCy, Gensim (LDA), NLTK |
| **Visualization** | Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly |
| **App & Deployment** | Streamlit |
| **Serialization** | Pickle, JSON |
| **Version Control** | Git, GitHub |

## Data Sources & Synthesis

### 1. PubMed Scientific Data  
Scientific abstracts (2020‚Äì2025) were extracted from **PubMed** and processed through a standard NLP pipeline ‚Äî tokenization, lemmatization, and topic extraction using **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**.  
The resulting topic embeddings represent the **semantic context** of scientific content, ensuring relevance-based recommendations.

### 2. Synthetic Real-World Data  
To simulate pharmaceutical engagement data, synthetic datasets were created for:
- [`hcp_master.csv`](data/hcp_master.csv): HCP demographics, specialty, and prescribing behavior  
- [`patients_with_hcp.csv`](data/patients_with_hcp.csv): Patient‚ÄìHCP linkages  
- [`campaigns_with_content.csv`](data/campaigns_with_content.csv): Content metadata and delivery channels  
- [`hcp_interaction_data.csv`](data/hcp_interaction_data.csv): Engagement histories used for model training  

These synthetic datasets replicate the **multi-dimensional nature of Real-World Evidence (RWE)** used in healthcare analytics.

## About the HCP Hybrid Recommendation System

The **HCP Hybrid Recommender System** is a **multi-modal deep learning architecture** built for healthcare marketing personalization.  
It learns from **past interactions, scientific content semantics, and peer behaviors** to predict:

- The most relevant scientific content for each HCP  
- The most effective engagement channel (email, webinar, digital, call)  

Unlike traditional recommenders, it combines **time-series behavioral modeling**, **semantic understanding**, and **collaborative learning** for a holistic recommendation strategy.

```

## Modeling Flow

1. Process raw engagement, campaign, and scientific data.
2. Extract embeddings from **LDA**, **LSTM**, and **collaborative matrices**.
3. Fuse all representations through a **dense feature fusion layer**.
4. Predict **Next Best Content (NBC)** and **Next Best Channel (NBC)** for each HCP.

## Why Hybrid Modeling?

Healthcare marketing data spans **behavioral**, **semantic**, and **contextual** dimensions.  
A single modeling approach often fails to capture the full picture.

| Model Type | Limitation | Hybrid Solution |
|------------|-----------|----------------|
| Collaborative Filtering | Ignores text semantics and sequence behavior | Combined with NLP and temporal modeling |
| Content-Based Models | Lack peer-level learning | Augmented by collaborative similarity |
| Sequential Models (LSTM) | Learn patterns but not content meaning | Enriched with topic and similarity embeddings |

The hybrid approach creates a **balanced model** capable of learning both *what* an HCP engages with and *why*, ensuring **scientifically relevant, data-driven recommendations**.

## HCP Recommender Dashboard Overview (Streamlit-Based)

The Streamlit-based dashboard provides an interactive interface for exploring model outputs and engagement insights.

### Key Features

- **HCP-Level Recommendations:** Displays Top-N recommended content and predicted channels.  
- **Engagement Analytics:** Visualizes historical interaction patterns, engagement rates, and channel effectiveness.  
- **Topic Insights:** Generates interpretable topic clusters and word clouds from PubMed data.  
- **Model Performance Metrics:**  Reports Top-K content recommendations and evaluates topic coherence for interpretability.

### Business Value

- Enables marketing and MSL teams to **target HCPs more effectively**.  
- Supports **data-driven omnichannel planning**.  
- Enhances **personalization** of medical content based on behavioral intelligence.
